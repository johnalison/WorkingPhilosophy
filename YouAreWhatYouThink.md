# You are what you think, but with practice, you can change what you think

- Perfection not required

- Begin Again

- Important truth that most people don't know/realize 

- Take the day a moment at a time. No need to rush into it, to rush to the next moment. The day will arrive anyway all on its own.

- Meditation is a fundamentally empirical exercise. 
    > Asks; What is the mind like when it is doing nothing but noticing whatever is in the 
    > stream of consciousness?
    > What is it like right now?

- We are our habitual thoughts

- Being mindful of thinking and emotion is the gateway to psychological well-being. (via Sam Harris) 

- "Where is the self if every sign of it is appearing in consciousness?" (via waking up)
   > Self is supposed to be the thing that is conscious. However only sign of the self is in consciousness.

- Emotion is the enemy, do whatever you can to take emotion out of the equation. 

- Mind as an enemy

   > Used to thinking of our minds as our allies.  However in reality,
   > minds are prone to laziness/want to believe a good story/dont
   > want to be challenged/ etc It is *reason* that is our ally and is
   > needed to keep our minds in check/unbiased.

- "Fear is the bodies preparation for action. 

   > Fear does things behind the scenes to get you physically ready.
   > Knowing that this is happening and feeling it work, can help
   > prepare the mind, prevent it from startling" (From Psychology of
   > the fighting man)

- Can satiate desire by thinking-about or being-aware-of desire. Don't necessarily have to indulge the desire. 

- How do you know you're not a brain in a vat?

   > Turns outs, you are a brain in a vat!  Everything you are, think,
   >   see, feel is electrical signals.  - Elon Musk
   
- Notice your emotions, dont necessarily act on them. (EQ)  

- Practicing mediation has the intention to be happier and to be better placed to make others happier. 
  To suffer less and to be a better placed to let other suffer less.

- The goal (system) of mediation is Wisdom. 

  > The wisdom that comes from recognizing how things already are in
  > each moment.  From stepping out of the fantasy life born of having
  > a mind that is constantly/perpetually distracted.

 - Why meditate?

   > "If you want to understand your mind, simply sit down and observe
   > it".  Simple, no rituals/ceremonies, nothing to join.
   > Understanding ourselves is possible.  Meditation is a pragmatic
   > methodology for doing it.  In meditating, we begin to see what
   > creates suffering in ourselves and what brings greater happiness
   > and peace.  When we see that we can make wiser choices.  As we
   > make wiser choices we become happier; as we become happier we
   > make wiser choices.  Leads to a spiral of greater fulfilment and
   > ease.
  
- What is enlightenment?

  > Is the mind free from the patterns/forces that cause suffering ?
  > Two forms/options: Are the patterns/forces uprooted ? Or, in the
  > moment of their arising are the patterns/forces seen through?

- Why would one want to meditate ? 

   > Mind is the basis for everything you experience in life, for any
   > contribution you can make to others.  Given this it makes sense
   > to train it. (We know what it is like to have an untrained mind).
   > An untrained mind allows us to be unhappy despite things being
   > about as good as they can possibly be.  Even when everything is
   > fine many of us are consumed by stress. Most of our time is spent
   > thinking of things we need/want to do, or wish we hadn't done.
   > We spend very little time truly content and focused on the
   > present. Because of this we often fail to really connect with
   > people around us.  Understanding our minds through meditation is
   > the best way to correct this.  Spend most of our lives seeking to
   > Become Happy.  However we can only truly Be Happy in the present.
   > Very few of us can come to rest in the present and experience the
   > peace and fulfillment available there.  The luckiest people in
   > the world still live on the treadmill. They reach their goals
   > only to find each was a kind of mirage.  Getting what you want
   > out of life is not quite good enough.  Conversely, its also true
   > that you can be happy in an emergency.  It is a fact of the human
   > mind that genuine well-being is available even in periods of
   > intense physical stress.  Meditation (paying closer attention to
   > the nature of your own mind) is the most direct way to discover
   > that.

-  Why use an App to meditate ? Is using an App a cop out ? 

   > Some can make progress in silence (Rare.) 
   > There is an enormous difference between having good and bad (or no) information.
   > Even professional athletes have coaches and trainers. 
   > Even experts can continually refine their practice. 

"Important to find the profound in the ordinary" - waking up

   >  Seems to be what "enlightened" people have found.
   >  Enjoy/Marvel at the moment for what it is, NOW. 

- Meditation is the art of realizing your are already fulfilled before you do/chase the next thing.

- Moods:
   
   > We tend to coarse grain how we feel ow what our moods are.  In
   > reality things are constantly changing.  Noticing that can help
   > break-up the apparent coarse graining.  The coarse graining is
   > not accurate and can lead to suffering.

- Two ways mind-fullness greatly improves your life.
  -) Give you space to reflect if something or some action is worth doing. 
  If the results of some action are likely to be good for you or good for the world. 
  It can allow for some wisdom to emerge that considers the big picture. 

  -) It can make even unavoidable and unpleasant experiences the source of psychological freedom. 
  By paying attention to you resistance and aversion you can watch these states of mind unravel and disappear.

- Only way to live without regret is to pay attention.

- Think about what you are going to do: 
  - Necessary and Enjoyable ?  --> Do it
  - Unnecessary ? -> Dont do it.
  - Necessary and Unenjoyable ? -> Use as a source of meditation. Feel aversion. 

- Two Steps to having a good life:
  -1) Be a good person (Be the good)
  -2) Pay attention  

- Accept life as it is. Do this whenever you can. The next moment is as good a time as you are likely to get. 

- Mediation is Quite unlike not meditating. Revolutionary thing to do. To be aware of liking and not liking an experience is a separable concept of the experience. 
  Need not always, in every case, be taken in by it (the liking or not liking).  
  This is a remarkable insight into the nature of consciousness. 
  Mindfulness can shown that which is away of unpleasant sensation is the same and feels the same as that which is aware of pleasant sensation. 
  There really is a kind of equanimity to consciousness, which is liberating.

- Goal of mediation: (if there is a goal) Is to give up the automatic struggle and acquire the ability to leave things as they are.

- Mediation: Its not something your doing. Its something your ceasing to do. Your ceasing to be distracted by thought. ITs acually not an inwardness, but an openness. Open to the world by paying attention.

- Its important to make a freind of your mind. Its really all you have. Got to know it for whats it is: An open space where things (sensations/thoughts/feelings) appear.
