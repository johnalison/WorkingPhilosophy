How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

Purpose of philosophy not to achieve some perfect ideal, but to keep becoming more complete, more happy, more “X and happy” where x = { sick, in danger, disgraced, etc} Philosophy should keep the well-being independent from the x, which is largely out of our control. 

Worth spending time and energy developing a plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 

What is Wisdom? 
"Noticing the causes of psychological suffering, noticing where they are unnecessary and then stop doing the things that are producing needless suffering"
- Sam Harris) 

Building character is one of the only important projects in life

"Philosophy isn’t a parlor trick or made for show. 
It’s not concerned with words, but with facts. 
It’s not employed for some pleasure before the day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. 
It shapes and builds up the soul, it gives order to life, guides action, shows what should and shouldn’t be done—it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertainties. 
Without it, no one can live without fear or free from care. 
Countless things happen every hour that require advice, and such advice is to be sought out in philosophy.”  - Seneca Moral Letters 1.6.3


[Random Interesting thoughts](#Random-Interesting-thoughts)


# Moral duty to become more rational.

- Learn from others mistakes
- Critical to look at things from as many different angles as possible.
    Good things: think about what could have gone differently. What was luck ? What good 
                          Planning?
     Bad things: Think how much worse it could have been. What was luck ? What bad  
                           Planning?
- Look at desires for what they are: A response of an algorithm trained 50k years ago in a   
  different environment. 
- Learn how to learn from those you disagree with  or even offend you. See if you can find the   
    “truth” in what they believe.  - Kevin Kelly
- “When you fall, pick something up”
- We are all biased even when/if we don't think we are.
> Eg: 
> Q: Who is the best/smartest person you work with?
> A: “The one who agrees with me most often is X”
> Most people unlikely to think highly of anyone whose view opposes your own. 
> Strive to recognize and reduce this bias.
> Try to use EQ/BQ to see where/when I have gut reaction to something, can check that for bias
 - Moderate positive reactions to “good luck”. See where it could have failed. What could have been improved. 

- whatever happens, no matter how bad have a way of looking/thinking about the situation to improve.

- See the role model in everyone.
  Important to try to emulate you want to be. 
  Role models can be amalgamations of people.
  Look for qualities that you want to emulate in other people, even if you dont want to be like the person.

- Make yourself dependable. 
  Deserve the things you want. 
  Its more important to deserve the things you wan than to have them.

- Try to maintain objectivity
> Automate good techniques: use check lists/protocols ect

- Need to tolerate both types of errors: 
    Type1 : “letting the bad in”
     Type2: “kicking the good out”  
  You are unlikely to be optimal unless you have some tolerance of both

- Want to be a learn-it-all not a know-it-all
  > Humility is the key to growth and leadership.  Stay humble and see what you can learn.


# You are what you think, but with practice, you can change what you think

- Perfection not required
- Begin Again
- Important truth that most people don't know/realize 
- Take the day a moment at a time. No need to rush into it, to rush to the next moment. The day will arrive anyway all on its own.
- Meditation:
-  Fundamentally empirical exercise. 
- Asks; What is the mind like when it is doing nothing but noticing whatever is in the 
  stream of consciousness?
What is it like right now?
- We are our habitual thoughts
- Being mindful of thinking and emotion is the gateway to psychological well-being. (via Sam Harris) 
- "Where is the self if every sign of it is appearing in consciousness?" (via waking up)
   > Self is supposed to be the thing that is conscious. However only sign of the self is in consciousness.
- Emotion is the enemy, do whatever you can to take emotion out of the equation. 
- Mind as an enemy
   - Used to thinking of our minds as our allies
   - However in reality, minds are prone to laziness/want to believe a good story/dont want to be challenged/ etc
   - It is *reason* that is our ally and is needed to keep our minds in check/unbiased.  
- "Fear is the bodies preparation for action. 
  Fear does things behind the scenes to get you physically ready. 
  Knowing that this is happening and feeling it work, can help prepare the mind, prevent it from startling" 
  (From Psychology of the fighting man)

- Can satiate desire by thinking-about  or being-aware-of desire. Don't necessarily have to indulge the desire. 
- How do you know you're not a brain in a vat?  Turns outs, you are a brain in a vat! 
  Everything you are, think, see, feel is electrical signals.  - Elon Musk
- Notice your emotions, dont necessarily act on them. (EQ)  
- Practicing mediation has the intention to be happier and to be better placed to make others happier. 
  To suffer less and to be a better place to let other suffer less.
- The goal (system) here is Wisdom. 
  The wisdom that comes from recognizing how things already are in each moment. 
  From stepping out of the fantasy life born of having a mind that is constantly/perpetually distracted.

# Strict with yourself, Lenient with others (Extreme Ownership)

- Poor Richard: Neglect kills injuries, Revenge increases them
- Need more forgiveness -> forgiveness is transcendence (transcends human nature) 
   (Good for mind / Good for future self)
- "We are bad men living among bad men, one thing that can calm us down is to be easy on each other" - William Irvine

# You can only control what you can control

- Respond don't react
- I am the only one whose opinion really matters. I am the one who sets the standard. Use criticism/praise for what its worth, but don't look too much into it.
- Happiness, peace, stillness, well-being come from within.
- Only your choices are good or evil. Everything else just happens.
- No point being upset with what happens.  Don't take it personally. Remove emotional coloring. 
- Some Stoicism: Objective things just are. They are not good or bad. They are just information. Only *your* reactions matter. Only *your* reactions are not simply given facts.
- Nothing can prevent you from getting better, becoming wiser. The obstacle is the way.
- Vast majority of our words/actions are unnecessary
  > Corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility

  > Shouldn't forget each moment to ask: "Is this one of the unnecessary things?"

  > Should kill both unnecessary thought and actions; unnecessary thoughts lead to unnecessary actions.

# Don't Lie! (Evil only possible through lies)

- Poor Richards Almanac: 
  “Keep conscience clean, then never fear”
- “The foundation of morality is to have done away, once and for all, with lying”
               - Thomas Huxley

- How can can I be more reliable ? 
  > Say what you mean, mean what you say.
  > Say what you do, do what you say.
- Dont cheat, dont mislead, dont talk behind others backs, dont act sneaky, dont avoid doing things you should or need to do
- Character is the only thing that matters. Character determines your fate. Character can never be taken away from you. 
  > Building character is one of the only important projects in life
  > Focus on character and the rest will fall into place. 

# Be the good: Intelligent ACTION is power

- To get what you want, deserve what you want - Charlie Munger
- “The great end of life is not knowledge, but action” - Thomas Huxley
- “Only thing that matters is doing the right thing right now. 
   > Past cannot be changed

   > Future is no assured 

   > The action in the present should be “right”

- “The used key is always bright” - Poor Richard
- “Not enough to think or say the right things, you have to act on them” - Shane Parish
- Stop thinking about what a good person is/does and be one.
- "Can get substantial improvement by deciding to be a better person. 
   Look around and see what traits you admire in others and then copy them. 
   Can lead to lasting, significant improvement."  - Warren Buffet
- Want some good ? Get it for yourself.  To have a good day, do good things
- Ideology is viral, Pragmatism is functional. 
  Pragmatism is what needs to be embraced in order to do.  
  Always look for the pragmatic over the Ideological 
- Today is the day, now is the time. This is when/how progress gets made. Live by doing. Do by focusing fully on the current task at hand.
   (See Standard Operating System)
- "Blow your own nose!" 
   You can sit there praying your nose wont run or wait for someone else to come along and wipe it. 
   Or you can blow your own nose, that's what you have hands for.
-  Do what is essential. 
    - Richard Heart “If you've been doing something for a while and it docent change your life (ie: what you do/think/believe), Why are you doing it ?”...Go do push-ups
- “Whats the next action?” Philosophy seems to be practical/effective and clarifying. 
- "Do whats essential" Most of what we do or say is not essential. If we can eliminate something that we do or say, there will be more time/energy and tranquility to do what is needed. 
  > Always ask "Is this necessary? "
- Dont count on motivation for long-term results. Count on discipline. Know  what to do and make yourself do it! 
- The Donts

  > Actions: Dont procrastinate

  > Conversations: Dont confuse

  > Thoughts: Dont wonder (focus)

  > Soul: Dont be Passive or Aggressive (moderation) 

  > Life: Dont be all about business (Not sure)

- Do the right thing because it is the right thing to do.  Dont need any other reason for doing something you know is right. Only need justification to do think you know are wrong.
- "Best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, second best time is today"
- "Those who will not risk, cannot win" - John Paul Jones
- "Often injustice lies in what your not doing"  - Shane Parrish
- Man who saved the world (Vasili Arkhipov) 
  > Sub officer who was sinavertiantly under attack during the Cuban missile crisis. 
  > Bombs exploded to get the subs to surface. 
  > Vasili's sub was not notified this was happening and assumed he was at war. But refused to launch nuclear war head.
- Make due with how things ARE.  Do not wait until thie perfect moment/mood/ 
  > "A good plan now is better than a perfect plan later" Patton
- If you can, do it now. (Seneca)
- "Do what nature demands of you. Get right to if its possible. Dont look around to see if people will know about it. Dont wait for perfection, be satisfied with any small progress, but push for more" Markus Aurelius
- Do not become trapped by idealism. 
  > Begin where the world is. Useless to delay action because things aren't perfect or the plan is not the best it could possibly be.
- Perfection is the enemy of action. 
- Real philosophers aren't concerned with authorship recognition, only with what actually works. 
  > What is said matters less than what is done.
- Lessons from the game theory strategy of tit-for-tat
  > It pays to go positive and to go first
  
  > People makes mistakes, it pays to forgive. (see hard with self, lenient with others) 

  > It is hard to forgive.

- Become what you want to be in the world and it will be so

- Small changes in your actions change your world

# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 
  No need to get emotional about these external events. 
  They, the external events, don't care about you. 
  You need to respond to the situation that has presented itself. 
  Emotional reactions only add your suffering and limit the scope of your response. 
  Use glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction. 

- Be the calm. Calm is contagious. 
  > Need to do more thinking before speaking.

# Memento Mori: All we have is time; lack of attention throws it away

- "Now we flourish as before others did. And soon others will whose children we shall never see."

- Death always with us, dying moment at a time.
 Important that death and its possibility color your life.

- Fight Club:  You always have a gun to your head: Need to make decisions have personal interactions with this in mind.

- **Alive time vs Dead time:**
  
   > You don't own anything! Anything you think you own goes away when you die, and you don't know when that is going to happen. Could be tomorrow or tonight. The only one thing that is yours , that you cant be taken away from you is time.  Guard and Value it with the respect it deserves.  It's all you have...

- Time is constantly running out, don't know how much you got

- Dont worry/think about things you dont like. No point looking down on someone or something that you dont like or find interesting. Move on, drop it. There is only so much time and energy (via Joe Rogan)

- Time is all you have. No one can take it from you. But you can throw it away from lack of attention if you are careless / not mindful. 

- **Attention:**

   > Attention is a finite resource 
   > Is the bricks and mortar of our life
   > Amazing how easily we let it be stolen from us

- Should live more as if you had been diagnosed with some terminal disease and were going to die soon.  In fact we all have a terminal disease: “The cause of death is birth” and we don't know how much longer we have to live. 

- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”
     Markus Aurelius
  Put everything that takes time or attention, costs money, or takes sacrifice through this filter.  

- Time is one think in negotiations or decision making that you can cant go back on. Cant undo. Time gives no mercy. 
  No amount of negotiation can recover lost time. its gone when its gone. 
  Time is one thing to pay attention to above all. How you use *your* time.

- Ones whole life is a succession of moment after moment. 
  > "Attention is the brick and mortar of our lives". Important to guard your time the respect it deserves. 

# Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy) 

- Anger/ Losing temper is never good, never improves the situation. Always best to “observe” the anger, Reflect then respond. Response always superior to reaction. Reaction is the embodiment of anger

- Poor Richards Almanac: “He who can compose himself is wiser than he who composes books”
  
- Getting angry never makes things better. To deal with stress need to get perspective (zoom way in or zoom way out). Return to the present moment. Accept the obstacle. (via Marcus Aurelius)  

- Dont make things worse: When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 
  Practically means that anger, action without plan (aka reaction) doesn't help, it hurts. 
  Remove emotion and make a plan (aka respond)

- Value time more than possessions. (Seneca)

- Be ruthless to things that dont matter.


### Stoic Test Strategy 
   > Set backs can be re-framed as challenges to test our strength of character. 
   > Re-framing turns negative situation into positive opportunity to prove yourself worthy.
   > We control how we frame situation we experience"
   > Re-framing helps us control our Response, allows up to be nice/decent to one another.
   > "We are bad men living among bad men, one thing that can calm us down is to be easy on each other"
   > Worth spending time and energy developing a plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 
 
 - We are fundamentally a divided self:  Mind vs Body. Conscious (rational) vs unconscious/emotions (automate/base) 
   Note: unconscious emotions are important. There is a lot that is easy at an intuitive level that is hard to rationalize ("gut feelings"). Often correct.
   Can use mindfulness/BQ has a hack to tap into these ancient algorithms

 - To succeed in a Stoic Test Challenge need 1) plan effective workarounds 2) avoid getting caught in negative emotions. 

  > **1st grade:** is how well I searched for a work-around. (Consider options ? / 2nd order thinking ? / Pick best option?)

  > **2nd grade:** (much more important) what was my emotional response ?

 - Can remove/silence/mute sub-conscious from loop by treating setback as *Stoic Test*.  (See "Disengage/Step back")
   Prevents emotions from coming online. Lowers "cost" of setback. Improves change of success.

- Several different possible frames for setbacks

  > **Blame frame:** sub-conscious default mode

  > **Competing Obligations:** what would've had to be given up for me to get my way ?

  > **Incompetence frame:** mal-intent was not the aim, people involved are just simply incompetent

  > **Story-telling frame:** think of what a great story this will be when its over. Can also be an example just for yourself (or your journal!) of how to deal with setbacks

  > **Comedic Frame:** look at the humor in the situation. Think that you are part of a sit com. 

  > **Game/Stoic-Test Frames:** what the whole stoic test challenge is all about!

- Emotions are bad for handling setbacks

  > Shatter any tranquility we may have had

  > Cloud our thinking on how to over come

- 1st response to setback should always be to prevent the onset of negative emotions. (More improvement needed here!!!)

  > Negative emotions: unproductive and often do more harm than the setback

- Our brains are powerful computers but with arcane operating systems. Stoics hacked the system. Our tendency to blame setbacks on others and get mad at the situation can be shutdown/short-circuited. If we act quickly.

- Another framing exercise: Cast "have to" into "get to". There will always be a potential future position from which what you "have to do" now would seem like a dream come true. 
  When you are annoyed that there is something that you "have to" do. Image it as the luxury of the future self.

# Systems Not Goals

- Habits compound interest of self improvement
- ceiling set by Goals, floor set by system
- Google 20%
- Improve ability to learn new things
- Practice is the key 
- Goal oriented vs Growth oriented 
  - In long run, growth is much more important that weather a particular goal was reached
- Growth:  
 > Cumulative
 > Can improve even if goal fails.
 > Strategy for long-term success (biggest/most-of-the payoff at the end)
 > (Event if you only care about goals, growth enables them!
- “You don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level  of you systems”  James Clever
   Idea: Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement
  - Seems insignificant at first
  - All payout back-loaded
- “You are what you consistently do” - Aristotle via Shane Parish 
- “Purpose of habit is to remove self-negotiation” - Kevin Kelly

- Role of Failure:  (Bill Ackmann)
 > Success is not a straight line

 > Successful people have to deal with hardship

 > How successful you are is a function of how you deal with failure.

 > If you deal with failure well and persist, you have a high probability of being successful

- If you want to do something, make a habit of it

      - Systems and Habits
      - Sleep 8 yrs/night
      - Low carb
      - Time restricted Feeding
      - Meditate
      - Exercise
      - Stuff capture / Next action
      - Journaling
      - Read

- How to act; how to figure out what to do. 
  Two simple (but not easy) steps: 

   1. Dont get upset 
       * Removes bias.
       * What happened had to, given what came before.
   
   2. Remember your values: principle and purpose
       * Eliminates the obviously wrong options/choices.
       * Choose from whats left

- What are my values?
   - Dont Lie
   - Look for lasting change (systems not goals) 
   - Golden rule (veil of ignorance) 
   - Strict with self/lenient with other
   - Increase freedom/liberty when possible
   - Equality of opportunity
   - ...

- "Coming back to a habit is the most powerful habit of all"
  > Having the right habits are critical: Having habit to form/continue habits. Habit of self-improvement. (these are like wishes for more wishes)
  
- Ideas for daily habits:
   - Single-tasking session: work on something for XX minutes with no distractions. 
   - Daily gratitude: What have you done well ? What love about yourself/others ? 

- Progress does not come from one big show of force.  
  Real, true, lasting progress comes from grinding things out. 

- When things are going bad Bad ... "Good"
  When things aren't going as expected ... "Good"
  Whey you dont get the promotion ... "Good"
  "Good" for resetting the frame of mind. Allows you to focus on the upside of any situation.

- **Focus on the present** Easy to get bogged down by the big picture. 
  This is really where __the operating system__ comes in. 
  Map out the big picture (ie: Zoom out), then focus on what the *next steps are* (ie: Zoom in). 
  Then readdress the Big picture as needed.

- Education and Stoicism are ongoing processes. Wisdom is pursued; it is not conferred/obtained/received.  You have not graduated. School is for life. 

- "Going through the motions" is a trick that allows you to overcome weakness on day when you are "not feeling it".

- How to push yourself (via Jocko)
  Need to balance emotion and logic to get more from yourself. When emotions are telling you to quit analyze them rationally (where do they come from ? Algorithms for ancient environment)  
  When logic is telling you to stop trying, turn-on emotion. 

- "Biggest generator of long-term results is learning to do things when you dont feel like doing them" - Shane parish

- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. 

- Plan to decisive Points
  > interesting strategy in military planning. 
  > Do not plan to achieve the objective directly. 
  > Plan to the "decisive point" which is the point after which you have a decisive advantage and clear path to victory.
  > eg: if your a strong grappler in a fight, your decisive point would be to get on the ground.

- Once the situation is upon you its too late.
  > you have to be prepared in advance. 
  > You need to know already who you are and what you believe. 
  > Not what you organization believes, not what your peers believe.
  > They way to do it is by working through issues of morality/mortality/ and honor for YOURSELF. 

## Standard Operating system: 
- Getting things done: art of stress-free productivity.  (David Allen) 
- Same method advocated by Zen Habits
- Basically: Write everything down, make a list, triage, focus entirely on one thing at a time.
- More detail
  > Start of the day: scan projects, come up with next actions
  
  > work mode: Pull from next actions 
  
  > Stuff list: as thing occur to me write them in inbox. 

- Daily routine: 
  > List of 3 main things to do and 2-3 minor things

  > Focus entirely on one of the top 3 until finished/stalled
  
  > Move on to the next until done

  > Select from next actions list



# Perfection Not required, effective self-improvement critical 

- Seek out feedback loops: these give an easy path to self-improvement. However its important that the noise is low (eg: poker not for decision theory). Would like to put this to use with glimpses/mindfulness.

- If you need to specialize,  should specialize in being the best version of yourself. Much better/more-productive than some esoteric or politics or sports trivia.  Positive feedback loop

- Inch-by-inch progress is made. 
“Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is no small thing” - Zeno
Related is concept of compounding interest
Get better at getting better. 

- “Begin Again” - Important skill that is underappreciated, Under-utilized. Useful as a mantra anytime there is a daunting task.

- Think of life as one long training/learning period.  Use life as a “sparing partner” that we are using to improve. It is important to be clear minded and respond to what is happening, but no need to take it personally. 

- Example: The American experiment. Country far from perfect when started (deeply flawed) with time the notion of citizen improved/expanded to be "more perfect".

- Anti-fragility:
Something is fragile if it easily breaks, robust if it does not break under stress, and anti-fragile if it gets stronger or improves under stress. 
Lots of stoic thoughts about how to improve under stress. 
Important to be able to try many low cost experiments and iterate. 
Think about what makes you anti-fragile. and where and how you can fail. 
How can you optimize worse case scenarios? 

Example of Anti-fragility (Jocko): Stresses (eg: not sleeping enough) actually makes him a better performer. More alert, more responsive, emotionally engaged. 

- Law of diminishing returns 
   - Example of 80/20 
   - Get the low hanging fruit
   - Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
   - Then choose what long sloughs to fith. 

- "Put your day up for review" (Seneca)

# Do not let your happiness (well-being) depend on things you cannot control

- Explains how people can be well-off an miserable or poor and happy
- Make Well-being depend only on things you can control
- Focus more on wanting what you have  
- Rejoice in your actions that lead to good outcomes
- Escape within: Possible way to derive happiness. 
- Meditation: Observing the mind
- Headless way: Focusing on 1st person perspective
- Study 
- Work
- Stop caring what other people think. Focus on what you think is good, is just etc. Cant let other peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work)  validate or bring you meaning. 
   Meaning must come from within. 
- To chase external approval and validation is to chase an illusion. A chimera constructed (for good reason) by Biology and Culture.  


# Leadership is a skill that can be taught/learned

- How do you become a better leader ? 
   >   - Listen to people
   >   - Avoid ideology 

- Leadership Tactic: Detach
  
   - Can often see correct path forward with some distance.
   - *Big Question* How do you remember to detach ? 
       > Partial Answer: Use body signals to measure monitor when you are caught up. 

       > eg: when you are getting angry/emotional clenching your jaw/fists (BQ!)

       > This indicates you are caught up in a probable/overly focused.

       > Feeling Strong emotions

       > Is your ego getting involved? (Jealousy a big sign of ego!)

       > Chaos that your getting swept up into
   - To detach, consciously send signals to you body: Lift head/chip up. Scan room from left to right. Breath. 
   - Gives you perspective/space to think.
   - Important to detach, see yourself in wider context. What are you doing ? What are you feeling?
   - Detachment provides position to make good/effective decisions
   - Whole challenge is recognizing/remembering when to detach.
   - Dont walk around detached all the time. Need cues/clues to detach
   - How to detach: 
      > Relinquish Reaction by simply noticing
      > Hard. Simple not easy. Drop all the second and higher order processing of inputs. 
      > And just notice them as they are. Can detect bugs (biases) in the lower-level processing of stimuli.

- "Leader on the front lines is always right". Even if what they are saying seems counter-intuitive, there is some truth to their lived experience.

# Random Interesting thoughts

- Importance of finding clarity:  
   Need clarity on:
     -  meaning/mission of life. 
     -  what your building to day-in/day-out
     - How to improve relationships

- "Tool worship is not art" Richard Heart 
   People often focus too much on the quality of the tools and less on what you make with them.

- "Only the tail events matter"
   Heard this in the context of investing: "99% of the economy in with +/- 2 sigma of the models/expectation and only the 1% on the tails matter"
   People sweating what 0.5% raise in interest rate would do and all of the sudden we get slammed with 20% unemployment. 

- You get what you reward for. (Big lesson from Biology) 

- Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. LIST  In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 

“Waste no time or Energy on grudges” Churchill 

Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

Mathematics used to have long standing unsolved problems ~100 years ago
   Riemann Hyp/ Fermat's Last theorem/ Continuum Hyphothese / Four color problem
3 of these have been solved, but in very non-traditional ways. 

Monster group: has as many elements as there are particles in Jupiter!! Whats it for  ? Why here ?

Potential in capitalism at the local level (eg: apparently now illegal for regular people to invest in start-ups, Reasons to think this could change (knowledge project #??) Could have huge impact on income inequality. 

Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants. 
   Especially now, critical to push hard on both of these.  Seems like the right has forgot   
    the former, and the left has forgot the latter.

What makes a good life ? What is the goal? 
Not hedonic happiness (HH): shouldn't expect this to be the goal. We were not selected for it.  HH is a tracer for what we were selected for. But not end in itself
If not happiness then what ?  (living according to a philosophy … ?)

Cryonics could be the most important thing you do. 
Cryonics could serve some similar function to belief in heaven for an atheist. 

Death is a puzzle to solve not some inevitable outcome to submit to.

QM is or brings, in a sense, the end of reduction-ism via entanglement.  In an entangled system, no way to reduce it to just the action of one of the spins.

“Avoid boring people, Avoid Boring you” James Watson

Someone asked Watson (or Deep-mind) what the purpose/meaning of life is, it replied
“To live forever”
Gene-level - immortality is the only goal
Human Instinct - gut reactions about avoiding death
Longevity Movement - rationally fighting against death

Work week - Interesting that in period 1870-1940 work week changed several times 12->10->8 hrs per day.  6->5 days per week.  No change in standard since.

Difference between stress and being stressed-out.
How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

"How you do everything is how you do anything"  
Counter point: Some problems are more important than others.  Resources Time/Energy finite. Need to triage. Allocate resources according to importance
Goal: First prioritize then bring the correct quantity/quality of resources to bear.n
Counter-counter point: I notice gut feeling when I cut corners (BQ!). Telling me I have probably not prioritized properly
Standard Operating system applies here (Literally HOW I do everything) 
Another pro-point: What you are currently doing could be the last thing you ever do!
On more thought, this actually seems like it cuts both ways, Do you really care how well you hung that photo if you are going to be nuked in 30s ?


Some AI thoughts
With trying to develop AI we are trying — racing— to create actual, no-bullshit Gods and almost no one is talking about it.  Its also not at all clear we will have much control over what kind of gods we create, and the consensus among experts is that it is something we are likely to do in the next 50-100 years and only get one shot at. Seems likely to lead to immortality or extinction.   

But, How much do people spend talking about the fact that soon they will spend the rest of eternity not existing ?

Related to above: How much smarter than humans can something get ? With narrow intelligence its clear there is a lot of room. General Intelligence its not obvious, eg: could asymptotic with humans being close to the max.  However even if “only” as smart as humans, AI will still be 10^6 times faster and have vast improvements in a wide range of narrow intelligence. 

AI is a tragedy of the commons: Globally want to take our time with AI (huge potential downside). Personally, (without radical longevity) I want to accelerate AU b/c the downside of not getting AI and dying is (almost certainly) the same as getting bad AI.

Like Elons response: Try to become the AI. Requires increasing bandwidth via neural-link.

Natural sources of exessential threat are essentially negligible compared to the human create ones.

Interesting idea: Gene sequence any medical cases where there is illness but we cannot make a diagnosis. Would allow us to catch potential problems sooner.

Reason for optimism: We have had a radical change in our relationship/outlook toward the environment since the 60s. Might be able to do something similar for exessential risk.

Thoughts about truth: 
Truth - reality / objective 
tribal truth - What your group agrees is true
Iterative truth - “git-lab” truth asymptotes to Truth

Negative Qualities:
Times when I act like I know something when I really don't
Forget what I already learned
Initial reactions to new things often biased negatively
Some people I dislike for no apparent reason
Sometimes get excited and open to many new threads

Interesting Point: 
_Slippery Slope_ problems can almost always be solved by reasonable practical judgement. 
 > Raising the speed limit by 1 mph is a slippery slope until too high, too much death. 
 > Yet we have a speed limit that is not 0 or infinity
 Should question all slippery slope arguments. 

Most important thing to learn is: We have so much to learn.  Realize this and open your mind.

Nuclear Safety

 > By far biggest problem of our time. Crazy we dont think/talk about it more. 
 > Biggest risk is accidental launch. Destroys Civilization. 
 > "All vs Nothing" approach to reductions is **wrong** way to think (but easy to get trapped by) 
 > Can make real progress by being pragmatic. 
 > eg: get rid of ICBMs - only 1st strike weapon. (and liability b/c costly  and they will be target of first strike) 
 >  get rid of presidential sole authorization - president cant go to way, but can destroy the planet) 
 > get rid of first strike

- "Minute to learn, lifetime to master" John Mayer re: guitar

- Bee sting: bodies response to the action worse than the initial attack. 

- Interesting fact: Hebrew only example of a language that died out, was dead for thousands of years then came back and now is the 1st language of millions of people.
   
- One of the best ways of talking to yourself is to talk with other people. And its important to talk to yourself to know what you think.

- Interesting Point: Assimilation  is Annihilation as far as culture is concerned. 

- Facts about Hitler: 
   > Used to have regular mustache, trimmed version was something WWI so their gas masks sealed properly. 
   > Keeping the trimmed mustache was a signal to his audience that he was a warrior and that the was still being fought.

- The holocaust is essentially/almost like a religious event. 
   > Happened seemingly out of nowhere/ taboos against asking why/how.  

- Thoughts on hiring (Jocko) 
   > Hire for capacity/raw talent NOT experience. 
   
   > Generalized skills almost always superior to specialized.

   > When recruiting for special forces, no one has experience

   > Personnel selection is Art not science
   
   > Q: "What if we train them and they leave ?" A: "What if we dont and they stay?"

   > Personnel is your biggest asset.

   > Personnel development should be your primary mission

   > "I'm just providing cover fire for my team"

   
- Thought on how to be "a man" (Jocko) 

  > Do things (Fix things/get out in nature/ etc) 

  > Learn things (Read books / develop skills) 

  > Work out (Get strong)

  > Learn how to fight (ju jitsu) 


- Humans take evolutionary path such that a lot of development happens after birth. New borns are essentially still fetuses. "Worms" that only really eat defecate, sleep and cry) 

- Cultural-level sublimation: Socially unacceptable impulses are substitute for symbolic acts. eg: head-hunting replaces ritual cannibalism replaces casual cannibalism.  
  Pinker argues  that manners and rules of high-society has a similar "taming" effect.
