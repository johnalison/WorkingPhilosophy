How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

Purpose of philosophy not to achieve some perfect ideal, but to keep becoming more complete, more happy, more “X and happy” where x = { sick, in danger, disgraced, etc} Philosophy should keep the well-being independent from the x, which is largely out of our control. 

Worth spending time and energy developing a plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 


What is Wisdom? 
"Noticing the causes of psychological suffering, noticing where they are unnecessary and then stop doing the things that are producing needless suffering"
- Sam Harris) 

Building character is one of the only important projects in life

"Philosophy isn’t a parlor trick or made for show. 
It’s not concerned with words, but with facts. 
It’s not employed for some pleasure before the day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. 
It shapes and builds up the soul, it gives order to life, guides action, shows what should and shouldn’t be done—it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertainties. 
Without it, no one can live without fear or free from care. 
Countless things happen every hour that require advice, and such advice is to be sought out in philosophy.”  - Seneca Moral Letters 1.6.3

Seeking wisdom and self-improvement is not a part-time job

Philosophy is a calling not a profession, Not something you forget about after work or on the weekends.

"The whole of life should be one course of thought how not to miss the right path.  Rumination and foresight enable one to determine the lie of life."

The oracles of wisdom are rare and they are rarely used. To seek advice does not lessen greatness or argue incapacity. 

The very wise are generally easily deceived, for while they know esoterica they do not know the ordinary things of life. Of what use is knowledge if it is not practical? To know how to live is true knowledge.

# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 
  No need to get emotional about these external events. 
  They, the external events, don't care about you. 
  You need to respond to the situation that has presented itself. 
  Emotional reactions only add your suffering and limit the scope of your response. 
  Use glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction. 

- Be the calm. Calm is contagious. 
  > Need to do more thinking before speaking.

# Memento Mori: All we have is time; lack of attention throws it away

- "Now we flourish as before others did. And soon others will whose children we shall never see."

- Death always with us, dying moment at a time.
 Important that death and its possibility color your life.

- Fight Club:  You always have a gun to your head: Need to make decisions have personal interactions with this in mind.

- **Alive time vs Dead time:**
  
   > You don't own anything! Anything you think you own goes away when you die, and you don't know when that is going to happen. Could be tomorrow or tonight. The only one thing that is yours , that you cant be taken away from you is time.  Guard and Value it with the respect it deserves.  It's all you have...

- Time is constantly running out, don't know how much you got

- Dont worry/think about things you dont like. No point looking down on someone or something that you dont like or find interesting. Move on, drop it. There is only so much time and energy (via Joe Rogan)

- Time is all you have. No one can take it from you. But you can throw it away from lack of attention if you are careless / not mindful. 

Some thoughts on time management:
  - Your time is limited. Reflect on death.
  - There are too many things you could do, need a way to decide which. (See the system) 
  - Get clear on what matters. 
  - Get good at focusing. (Use mindfulness to feel when you are pulling away, then lean back in)

- **Attention:**

   > Attention is a finite resource 
   > Is the bricks and mortar of our life
   > Amazing how easily we let it be stolen from us


- Should live more as if you had been diagnosed with some terminal disease and were going to die soon.  In fact we all have a terminal disease: “The cause of death is birth” and we don't know how much longer we have to live. 

- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”
     Markus Aurelius
  Put everything that takes time or attention, costs money, or takes sacrifice through this filter.  

- Time is one think in negotiations or decision making that you can cant go back on. Cant undo. Time gives no mercy. 
  No amount of negotiation can recover lost time. its gone when its gone. 
  Time is one thing to pay attention to above all. How you use *your* time.

- Ones whole life is a succession of moment after moment. 
  > "Attention is the brick and mortar of our lives". Important to guard your time the respect it deserves. 

- How to be present and Alive in the moment:  Shift from doing to being: more present, joyful, appreciative. 
  > Practice pouring yourself into every act (being fully in all/everything you do)
  
  > Feel emotion

  > See the good around you, in the people you interact with 

# Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy) 

- Anger/ Losing temper is never good, never improves the situation. Always best to “observe” the anger, Reflect then respond. Response always superior to reaction. Reaction is the embodiment of anger

- Poor Richards Almanac: “He who can compose himself is wiser than he who composes books”
  
- Getting angry never makes things better. To deal with stress need to get perspective (zoom way in or zoom way out). Return to the present moment. Accept the obstacle. (via Marcus Aurelius)  

- Dont make things worse: When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 
  Practically means that anger, action without plan (aka reaction) doesn't help, it hurts. 
  Remove emotion and make a plan (aka respond)

- Value time more than possessions. (Seneca)

- Be ruthless to things that dont matter.

- What is the thing you should be the most focused on ?
   A: Staying calm/steadying your nerves.  Emotional, uncontrolled responses only ever make things worse.


### Stoic Test Strategy 
   > Set backs can be re-framed as challenges to test our strength of character. 
   > Re-framing turns negative situation into positive opportunity to prove yourself worthy.
   > We control how we frame situation we experience"
   > Re-framing helps us control our Response, allows up to be nice/decent to one another.
   > "We are bad men living among bad men, one thing that can calm us down is to be easy on each other"
   > Worth spending time and energy developing a plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 
 
 - We are fundamentally a divided self:  Mind vs Body. Conscious (rational) vs unconscious/emotions (automate/base) 
   Note: unconscious emotions are important. There is a lot that is easy at an intuitive level that is hard to rationalize ("gut feelings"). Often correct.
   Can use mindfulness/BQ has a hack to tap into these ancient algorithms

 - To succeed in a Stoic Test Challenge need 1) plan effective workarounds 2) avoid getting caught in negative emotions. 

  > **1st grade:** is how well I searched for a work-around. (Consider options ? / 2nd order thinking ? / Pick best option?)

  > **2nd grade:** (much more important) what was my emotional response ?

 - Can remove/silence/mute sub-conscious from loop by treating setback as *Stoic Test*.  (See "Disengage/Step back")
   Prevents emotions from coming online. Lowers "cost" of setback. Improves change of success.

- Several different possible frames for setbacks

  > **Blame frame:** sub-conscious default mode

  > **Competing Obligations:** what would've had to be given up for me to get my way ?

  > **Incompetence frame:** mal-intent was not the aim, people involved are just simply incompetent

  > **Story-telling frame:** think of what a great story this will be when its over. Can also be an example just for yourself (or your journal!) of how to deal with setbacks

  > **Comedic Frame:** look at the humor in the situation. Think that you are part of a sit com. 

  > **Game/Stoic-Test Frames:** what the whole stoic test challenge is all about!

- Emotions are bad for handling setbacks

  > Shatter any tranquility we may have had

  > Cloud our thinking on how to over come

- 1st response to setback should always be to prevent the onset of negative emotions. (More improvement needed here!!!)

  > Negative emotions: unproductive and often do more harm than the setback

- Our brains are powerful computers but with arcane operating systems. Stoics hacked the system. Our tendency to blame setbacks on others and get mad at the situation can be shutdown/short-circuited. If we act quickly.

- Another framing exercise: Cast "have to" into "get to". There will always be a potential future position from which what you "have to do" now would seem like a dream come true. 
  When you are annoyed that there is something that you "have to" do. Image it as the luxury of the future self.

- Its OK to get mad, not to be angry. Getting mad is a reaction, instinctive, beyond control.  Becoming angry is a state of mind. Something that clouds later judgements. When mad make conscious decision not to get angry. 

- Maintain Composure, Maintain Control
THings will go wrong. Thinkgs will not go as expected. Dont let chaos reign. Recognize the situation and detach. When you lose the beat, gather yourself and get back into the beat. 

# Systems Not Goals

- Habits compound interest of self improvement
- ceiling set by Goals, floor set by system
- Google 20%
- Improve ability to learn new things
- Practice is the key 
- Goal oriented vs Growth oriented 
  - In long run, growth is much more important that weather a particular goal was reached
- Growth:  
 > Cumulative
 > Can improve even if goal fails.
 > Strategy for long-term success (biggest/most-of-the payoff at the end)
 > (Event if you only care about goals, growth enables them!
- “You don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level  of you systems”  James Clever
   Idea: Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement
  - Seems insignificant at first
  - All payout back-loaded
- “You are what you consistently do” - Aristotle via Shane Parish 
- “Purpose of habit is to remove self-negotiation” - Kevin Kelly

- Role of Failure:  (Bill Ackmann)
 > Success is not a straight line

 > Successful people have to deal with hardship

 > How successful you are is a function of how you deal with failure.

 > If you deal with failure well and persist, you have a high probability of being successful

- If you want to do something, make a habit of it

      - Systems and Habits
      - Sleep 8 yrs/night
      - Low carb
      - Time restricted Feeding
      - Meditate
      - Exercise
      - Stuff capture / Next action
      - Journaling
      - Read

- How to act; how to figure out what to do. 
  Two simple (but not easy) steps: 

   1. Dont get upset 
       * Removes bias.
       * What happened had to, given what came before.
   
   2. Remember your values: principle and purpose
       * Eliminates the obviously wrong options/choices.
       * Choose from whats left

- What are my values?
   - Dont Lie
   - Look for lasting change (systems not goals) 
   - Golden rule (veil of ignorance) 
   - Strict with self/lenient with other
   - Increase freedom/liberty when possible
   - Equality of opportunity
   - ...

- "Coming back to a habit is the most powerful habit of all"
  > Having the right habits are critical: Having habit to form/continue habits. Habit of self-improvement. (these are like wishes for more wishes)
  
- Ideas for daily habits:
   - Single-tasking session: work on something for XX minutes with no distractions. 
   - Daily gratitude: What have you done well ? What love about yourself/others ? 

- Progress does not come from one big show of force.  
  Real, true, lasting progress comes from grinding things out. 

- When things are going bad ... "Good"
  When things aren't going as expected ... "Good"
  Whey you dont get the promotion ... "Good"
  "Good" for resetting the frame of mind. Allows you to focus on the upside of any situation.

- **Focus on the present** Easy to get bogged down by the big picture. 
  This is really where __the operating system__ comes in. 
  Map out the big picture (ie: Zoom out), then focus on what the *next steps are* (ie: Zoom in). 
  Then readdress the Big picture as needed.

- Education and Stoicism are ongoing processes. Wisdom is pursued; it is not conferred/obtained/received.  You have not graduated. School is for life. 

- "Going through the motions" is a trick that allows you to overcome weakness on day when you are "not feeling it".

- How to push yourself (via Jocko)
  Need to balance emotion and logic to get more from yourself. When emotions are telling you to quit analyze them rationally (where do they come from ? Algorithms for ancient environment)  
  When logic is telling you to stop trying, turn-on emotion. 

- "Biggest generator of long-term results is learning to do things when you dont feel like doing them" - Shane parish

- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. 

- Plan to decisive Points
  > interesting strategy in military planning. 
  > Do not plan to achieve the objective directly. 
  > Plan to the "decisive point" which is the point after which you have a decisive advantage and clear path to victory.
  > eg: if your a strong grappler in a fight, your decisive point would be to get on the ground.

- Once the situation is upon you its too late.
  > you have to be prepared in advance. 
  > You need to know already who you are and what you believe. 
  > Not what you organization believes, not what your peers believe.
  > They way to do it is by working through issues of morality/mortality/ and honor for YOURSELF. 

- Habbit Dip: 
  > You'll always hit a dip in energy/motivation (Thats the bad news) 
  > The good news: Dips are temporary, provide and opportunity to learn.

  > "Learn the Dip" Learn how to face difficulty, let go of the ideal, deal with frustration. 

  > Critical to come into dip with learning mindset. Less idealistic, more curiosity. USE MINDFULNESS!


## Standard Operating system: 
- Getting things done: art of stress-free productivity.  (David Allen) 
- Same method advocated by Zen Habits
- Basically: Write everything down, make a list, triage, focus entirely on one thing at a time.
- More detail
  > Start of the day: scan projects, come up with next actions
  
  > work mode: Pull from next actions 
  
  > Stuff list: as thing occur to me write them in inbox. 

- Daily routine: 
  > List of 3 main things to do and 2-3 minor things

  > Focus entirely on one of the top 3 until finished/stalled
  
  > Move on to the next until done

  > Select from next actions list



# Perfection Not required, effective self-improvement critical 

- Seek out feedback loops: these give an easy path to self-improvement. However its important that the noise is low (eg: poker not for decision theory). Would like to put this to use with glimpses/mindfulness.

- If you need to specialize,  should specialize in being the best version of yourself. Much better/more-productive than some esoteric or politics or sports trivia.  Positive feedback loop

- Inch-by-inch progress is made. 
“Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is no small thing” - Zeno
Related is concept of compounding interest
Get better at getting better. 

- “Begin Again” - Important skill that is underappreciated, Under-utilized. Useful as a mantra anytime there is a daunting task.

- Think of life as one long training/learning period.  Use life as a “sparing partner” that we are using to improve. It is important to be clear minded and respond to what is happening, but no need to take it personally. 

- Example: The American experiment. Country far from perfect when started (deeply flawed) with time the notion of citizen improved/expanded to be "more perfect".

- Anti-fragility:
Something is fragile if it easily breaks, robust if it does not break under stress, and anti-fragile if it gets stronger or improves under stress. 
Lots of stoic thoughts about how to improve under stress. 
Important to be able to try many low cost experiments and iterate. 
Think about what makes you anti-fragile. and where and how you can fail. 
How can you optimize worse case scenarios? 

Example of Anti-fragility (Jocko): Stresses (eg: not sleeping enough) actually makes him a better performer. More alert, more responsive, emotionally engaged. 

- Law of diminishing returns 
   - Example of 80/20 
   - Get the low hanging fruit
   - Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
   - Then choose what long sloughs to fith. 

- "Put your day up for review" (Seneca)

# Do not let your happiness (well-being) depend on things you cannot control

- Explains how people can be well-off an miserable or poor and happy
- Make Well-being depend only on things you can control
- Focus more on wanting what you have  
- Rejoice in your actions that lead to good outcomes
- Escape within: Possible way to derive happiness. 
- Meditation: Observing the mind
- Headless way: Focusing on 1st person perspective
- Study 
- Work
- Stop caring what other people think. Focus on what you think is good, is just etc. Cant let other peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work)  validate or bring you meaning. 
   Meaning must come from within. 
- To chase external approval and validation is to chase an illusion. A chimera constructed (for good reason) by Biology and Culture.  
- Stoic way to pray: Instead of asking/hoping for something to happen, ask for the strength to overcome it when it doesn't happen.
- Dont need a reason to be happy or tranquil. You know what its like to be in that state, just do it. If you still need a reason: You're not dead yet, still in the game.

# Leadership is a skill that can be taught/learned

- How do you become a better leader ? 
   >   - Listen to people
   >   - Avoid ideology 

- Leadership Tactic: Detach
  
   - Can often see correct path forward with some distance.
   - *Big Question* How do you remember to detach ? 
       > Partial Answer: Use body signals to measure monitor when you are caught up. 

       > eg: when you are getting angry/emotional clenching your jaw/fists (BQ!)

       > This indicates you are caught up in a probable/overly focused.

       > Feeling Strong emotions

       > Is your ego getting involved? (Jealousy a big sign of ego!)

       > Chaos that your getting swept up into
   - To detach, consciously send signals to you body: Lift head/chip up. Scan room from left to right. Breath. 
   - Gives you perspective/space to think.
   - Important to detach, see yourself in wider context. What are you doing ? What are you feeling?
   - Detachment provides position to make good/effective decisions
   - Whole challenge is recognizing/remembering when to detach.
   - Dont walk around detached all the time. Need cues/clues to detach
   - How to detach: 
      > Relinquish Reaction by simply noticing
      > Hard. Simple not easy. Drop all the second and higher order processing of inputs. 
      > And just notice them as they are. Can detect bugs (biases) in the lower-level processing of stimuli.

- "Leader on the front lines is always right". Even if what they are saying seems counter-intuitive, there is some truth to their lived experience.

# Random Interesting thoughts

- Importance of finding clarity:  
   Need clarity on:
     -  meaning/mission of life. 
     -  what your building to day-in/day-out
     - How to improve relationships

- "Tool worship is not art" Richard Heart 
   People often focus too much on the quality of the tools and less on what you make with them.

- "Only the tail events matter"
   Heard this in the context of investing: "99% of the economy in with +/- 2 sigma of the models/expectation and only the 1% on the tails matter"
   People sweating what 0.5% raise in interest rate would do and all of the sudden we get slammed with 20% unemployment. 

- You get what you reward for. (Big lesson from Biology) 

- Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. LIST  In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 

“Waste no time or Energy on grudges” Churchill 

Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

Mathematics used to have long standing unsolved problems ~100 years ago
   Riemann Hyp/ Fermat's Last theorem/ Continuum Hyphothese / Four color problem
3 of these have been solved, but in very non-traditional ways. 

Monster group: has as many elements as there are particles in Jupiter!! Whats it for  ? Why here ?

Potential in capitalism at the local level (eg: apparently now illegal for regular people to invest in start-ups, Reasons to think this could change (knowledge project #??) Could have huge impact on income inequality. 

Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants. 
   Especially now, critical to push hard on both of these.  Seems like the right has forgot   
    the former, and the left has forgot the latter.

What makes a good life ? What is the goal? 
Not hedonic happiness (HH): shouldn't expect this to be the goal. We were not selected for it.  HH is a tracer for what we were selected for. But not end in itself
If not happiness then what ?  (living according to a philosophy … ?)

Cryonics could be the most important thing you do. 
Cryonics could serve some similar function to belief in heaven for an atheist. 

Death is a puzzle to solve not some inevitable outcome to submit to.

QM is or brings, in a sense, the end of reduction-ism via entanglement.  In an entangled system, no way to reduce it to just the action of one of the spins.

“Avoid boring people, Avoid Boring you” James Watson

Someone asked Watson (or Deep-mind) what the purpose/meaning of life is, it replied
“To live forever”
Gene-level - immortality is the only goal
Human Instinct - gut reactions about avoiding death
Longevity Movement - rationally fighting against death

Work week - Interesting that in period 1870-1940 work week changed several times 12->10->8 hrs per day.  6->5 days per week.  No change in standard since.

Difference between stress and being stressed-out.
How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

"How you do everything is how you do anything"  
Counter point: Some problems are more important than others.  Resources Time/Energy finite. Need to triage. Allocate resources according to importance
Goal: First prioritize then bring the correct quantity/quality of resources to bear.n
Counter-counter point: I notice gut feeling when I cut corners (BQ!). Telling me I have probably not prioritized properly
Standard Operating system applies here (Literally HOW I do everything) 
Another pro-point: What you are currently doing could be the last thing you ever do!
On more thought, this actually seems like it cuts both ways, Do you really care how well you hung that photo if you are going to be nuked in 30s ?


Some AI thoughts
With trying to develop AI we are trying — racing— to create actual, no-bullshit Gods and almost no one is talking about it.  Its also not at all clear we will have much control over what kind of gods we create, and the consensus among experts is that it is something we are likely to do in the next 50-100 years and only get one shot at. Seems likely to lead to immortality or extinction.   

But, How much do people spend talking about the fact that soon they will spend the rest of eternity not existing ?

Related to above: How much smarter than humans can something get ? With narrow intelligence its clear there is a lot of room. General Intelligence its not obvious, eg: could asymptotic with humans being close to the max.  However even if “only” as smart as humans, AI will still be 10^6 times faster and have vast improvements in a wide range of narrow intelligence. 

AI is a tragedy of the commons: Globally want to take our time with AI (huge potential downside). Personally, (without radical longevity) I want to accelerate AU b/c the downside of not getting AI and dying is (almost certainly) the same as getting bad AI.

Like Elons response: Try to become the AI. Requires increasing bandwidth via neural-link.

Natural sources of existential threat are essentially negligible compared to the human create ones.

Interesting idea: Gene sequence any medical cases where there is illness but we cannot make a diagnosis. Would allow us to catch potential problems sooner.

Reason for optimism: We have had a radical change in our relationship/outlook toward the environment since the 60s. Might be able to do something similar for existential risk.

Thoughts about truth: 
Truth - reality / objective 
tribal truth - What your group agrees is true
Iterative truth - “git-lab” truth asymptotic to Truth

Negative Qualities:
Times when I act like I know something when I really don't
Forget what I already learned
Initial reactions to new things often biased negatively
Some people I dislike for no apparent reason
Sometimes get excited and open to many new threads

Interesting Point: 
_Slippery Slope_ problems can almost always be solved by reasonable practical judgement. 
 > Raising the speed limit by 1 mph is a slippery slope until too high, too much death. 
 > Yet we have a speed limit that is not 0 or infinity
 Should question all slippery slope arguments. 

Most important thing to learn is: We have so much to learn.  Realize this and open your mind.

Nuclear Safety

 > By far biggest problem of our time. Crazy we dont think/talk about it more. 
 > Biggest risk is accidental launch. Destroys Civilization. 
 > "All vs Nothing" approach to reductions is **wrong** way to think (but easy to get trapped by) 
 > Can make real progress by being pragmatic. 
 > eg: get rid of ICBMs - only 1st strike weapon. (and liability b/c costly  and they will be target of first strike) 
 >  get rid of presidential sole authorization - president cant go to way, but can destroy the planet) 
 > get rid of first strike

- "Minute to learn, lifetime to master" John Mayer re: guitar

- Bee sting: bodies response to the action worse than the initial attack. 

- Interesting fact: Hebrew only example of a language that died out, was dead for thousands of years then came back and now is the 1st language of millions of people.
   
- One of the best ways of talking to yourself is to talk with other people. And its important to talk to yourself to know what you think.

- Interesting Point: Assimilation  is Annihilation as far as culture is concerned. 

- Facts about Hitler: 
   > Used to have regular mustache, trimmed version was something WWI so their gas masks sealed properly. 
   > Keeping the trimmed mustache was a signal to his audience that he was a warrior and that the was still being fought.

- The holocaust is essentially/almost like a religious event. 
   > Happened seemingly out of nowhere/ taboos against asking why/how.  

- Thoughts on hiring (Jocko) 
   > Hire for capacity/raw talent NOT experience. 
   
   > Generalized skills almost always superior to specialized.

   > When recruiting for special forces, no one has experience

   > Personnel selection is Art not science
   
   > Q: "What if we train them and they leave ?" A: "What if we dont and they stay?"

   > Personnel is your biggest asset.

   > Personnel development should be your primary mission

   > "I'm just providing cover fire for my team"

   
- Thought on how to be "a man" (Jocko) 

  > Do things (Fix things/get out in nature/ etc) 

  > Learn things (Read books / develop skills) 

  > Work out (Get strong)

  > Learn how to fight (ju jitsu) 

- Humans take evolutionary path such that a lot of development happens after birth. New borns are essentially still fetuses. "Worms" that only really eat defecate, sleep and cry) 

- Cultural-level sublimation: Socially unacceptable impulses are substitute for symbolic acts. eg: head-hunting replaces ritual cannibalism replaces casual cannibalism.  
  Pinker argues  that manners and rules of high-society has a similar "taming" effect.

- Original Thinking: "Ill surely take the older well-worn path, but if I find a shorter, smoother way, Ill blaze a trail there. 
  The ones who  pioneered these paths are our guides, not our masters. Truth is open to everyone" - Seneca
  Today's conservative ideas where once controversial, cutting-edge, and innovative.

- Police Violence: Police should be allowed to use choke holds. Much safer than tasers (where head can hit ground) and much more effective if you know what your doing.

- Social media (From Social Dilemma) 
   > Lies and captures our attention for profit.
   > Creating systems that people (or governments) can use to manipulate mass populations
   > Claim: This is existential threat
   > Claim: Example of where AI is already in charge


Words that are always true and meaningful; "This too, shall pass."

- "Diversity is protection against ignorance" Diversification not good/stupid if you know what your doing. 'Just put all your money in the best companies" -Buffet. 
   Diversity is an effective hedge if you dont know whats going on, a good way to get average performance.


Compassion: (Claim) Being compassionate is good for your health. At the same level of exercising and eating right. (Skeptical)

Importance of Filtering. (Especially in today's world) Knowing what, when and how to filter is critical to being productive. Knowing what to believe, seeing truth.

Julius Caesar felt like he hadn't accomplished much (40) compared to Alexander (32)

Human Intelligence is incredibly useful, but doesn't prevent you from having false beliefs. 
That's not what intelligence is for. Intelligence is associated with coming up with more convincing bullshit and with being better liars/. 
Not the ability to recognize our own bias.  
Event worse: There is selection pressure  to be unpredictable. A great (easy) way to be unpredictable is to not know yourself. 
Evolution shields us from self-knowledge.  Minds shrouded in darkness.

Strange that the American libertarian 2nd Amendment "fire wall" types that are out to protect the constitution have aligned with the candidate that is the biggest threat to the democracy.

Markus Aurelius on Anger: Not manly to get angry. Not natural either. Better to be calm and controlled. Better to treat people with kindness. Dont go around expecting Plato's republic.  There are obstacles in the path ? Go around them. Why get angry ? Do you thing the world would notice ? or care ?

Strange how much money is in collecting data, but how little data we collect about ourselves. 

Deep Fakes: 
 - Claim: Now have better quality A/V production than Hollywood
 - How will we be able to tell whats true and false?
    - Could use high-fidelity lie detector tests. (Not clear if this is feasible/being looked into)
    - ML can try to authenticate (leads to arms race)
    - Some form of "water-marking" to guarantee authenticity
 My thoughts: Did similar issues arise with other media ? eg: faking  quotes in print ? 
   Will probably fall to content providers/eye-witnesses.

How smart/plugged-in do you need to be to properly participate in democracy? And how do these requirements change with time?
Claim: (Dan Carlin) the fraction of people that are informed enough to participate today is lower than anytime in the past.

"Ends justify the means" vs "How you play the game"
Claim: Not in our interest to have a federal policy on torture. (Even if effects, although seems it is not)
Eisenhower quote on being careful not to destroy the thing you're trying to defend from within.
Seems right to me. If we are the "home of the brave" need to sacrifice some security for our freedom.
Terrorists win if they reshape our ethics and morals by responding to thier actions.

United States has had 250 year history of becoming more democratic. 
Now elect senitors, blacks and women can vote. ect. 
Been a while since we took another step forward.
Can argue that recent gerrymandering/voter suppression is a step back. 
Covid and mail-in voting could be a step forward.

American Icebergs (via Dan Carlin):
Issues that are major problems that could destroy our country. 
Claim:  Neigher party addressing these. (Actually significatnt pressure within both parties to NOT address these)
Some radical change probably needed to make progress here.
1) Corruption too many lobbiest with too much influence to solve real problems 
   (eg: insurance companies have to "OK" health care reform)
   taints everything, all solutions to problems
2) Constitutional checks and balances
   Executive branch too much power. Nuclear Bombs, 9/11 spying, wars without congress
3) Forigen Policy: Ratcheting up tensions with Russia (Reckless) 
   Constant/Continual war on terror.
   US as "world police" citizens dont want it. 
4) US middle class jobs disappearing. Middle class is the balast of society. 
   How to cope when/if foundation shaken/broken? 

Better to trip with your feet that with your words. Better to screw up doing than saying.
That which is done can be undone, that which is said cannot be unsaid.


The work of living is to set STANDARDs and to live by them. Dont comrimise. 
Judge all you say, do, and the opinions you hold by your standards.  "Are these consistent with my beliefs?" "Are these what the persion I want to be would do?"
