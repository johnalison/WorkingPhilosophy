How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

Purpose of philosophy not to achieve some perfect ideal, but to keep becoming more complete, more happy, more “X and happy” where x = { sick, in danger, disgraced, etc} Philosophy should keep the well-being independent from the x, which is largely out of our control. 

Worth spending time and energy developing a plan to minimize emotional harm from unexpected (and inevitable) setbacks. 


What is Wisdom? 
"Noticing the causes of psychological suffering, noticing where they are unnecessary and then stop doing the things that are producing needless suffering"
- Sam Harris) 

Building character is one of the only important projects in life

"Philosophy isn’t a parlor trick or made for show. 
It’s not concerned with words, but with facts. 
It’s not employed for some pleasure before the day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. 
It shapes and builds up the soul, it gives order to life, guides action, shows what should and shouldn’t be done—it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertainties. 
Without it, no one can live without fear or free from care. 
Countless things happen every hour that require advice, and such advice is to be sought out in philosophy.”  - Seneca Moral Letters 1.6.3

Seeking wisdom and self-improvement is not a part-time job

Philosophy is a calling not a profession, Not something you forget about after work or on the weekends.

"The whole of life should be one course of thought how not to miss the right path.  Rumination and foresight enable one to determine the lie of life."

The oracles of wisdom are rare and they are rarely used. To seek advice does not lessen greatness or argue incapacity. 

The very wise are generally easily deceived, for while they know esoterica they do not know the ordinary things of life. Of what use is knowledge if it is not practical? To know how to live is true knowledge.

   - Equality of opportunity

# Do not let your happiness (well-being) depend on things you cannot control

- Explains how people can be well-off an miserable or poor and happy
- Make Well-being depend only on things you can control
- Focus more on wanting what you have  
- Rejoice in your actions that lead to good outcomes
- Escape within: Possible way to derive happiness. 
- Meditation: Observing the mind
- Headless way: Focusing on 1st person perspective
- Study 
- Work
- Stop caring what other people think. Focus on what you think is good, is just etc. Cant let other peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work)  validate or bring you meaning. 
   Meaning must come from within. 
- To chase external approval and validation is to chase an illusion. A chimera constructed (for good reason) by Biology and Culture.  
- Stoic way to pray: Instead of asking/hoping for something to happen, ask for the strength to overcome it when it doesn't happen.
- Dont need a reason to be happy or tranquil. You know what its like to be in that state, just do it. If you still need a reason: You're not dead yet, still in the game.

# Leadership is a skill that can be taught/learned

- How do you become a better leader ? 
   >   - Listen to people
   >   - Avoid ideology 

- Leadership Tactic: Detach
  
   - Can often see correct path forward with some distance.
   - *Big Question* How do you remember to detach ? 
       > Partial Answer: Use body signals to measure monitor when you are caught up. 

       > eg: when you are getting angry/emotional clenching your jaw/fists (BQ!)

       > This indicates you are caught up in a probable/overly focused.

       > Feeling Strong emotions

       > Is your ego getting involved? (Jealousy a big sign of ego!)

       > Chaos that your getting swept up into
   - To detach, consciously send signals to you body: Lift head/chip up. Scan room from left to right. Breath. 
   - Gives you perspective/space to think.
   - Important to detach, see yourself in wider context. What are you doing ? What are you feeling?
   - Detachment provides position to make good/effective decisions
   - Whole challenge is recognizing/remembering when to detach.
   - Dont walk around detached all the time. Need cues/clues to detach
   - How to detach: 
      > Relinquish Reaction by simply noticing
      > Hard. Simple not easy. Drop all the second and higher order processing of inputs. 
      > And just notice them as they are. Can detect bugs (biases) in the lower-level processing of stimuli.

- "Leader on the front lines is always right". Even if what they are saying seems counter-intuitive, there is some truth to their lived experience.

# Random Interesting thoughts

- Importance of finding clarity:  
   Need clarity on:
     -  meaning/mission of life. 
     -  what your building to day-in/day-out
     - How to improve relationships

- "Tool worship is not art" Richard Heart 
   People often focus too much on the quality of the tools and less on what you make with them.

- "Only the tail events matter"
   Heard this in the context of investing: "99% of the economy in with +/- 2 sigma of the models/expectation and only the 1% on the tails matter"
   People sweating what 0.5% raise in interest rate would do and all of the sudden we get slammed with 20% unemployment. 

- You get what you reward for. (Big lesson from Biology) 

- Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. LIST  In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 

“Waste no time or Energy on grudges” Churchill 

Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

Mathematics used to have long standing unsolved problems ~100 years ago
   Riemann Hyp/ Fermat's Last theorem/ Continuum Hyphothese / Four color problem
3 of these have been solved, but in very non-traditional ways. 

Monster group: has as many elements as there are particles in Jupiter!! Whats it for  ? Why here ?

Potential in capitalism at the local level (eg: apparently now illegal for regular people to invest in start-ups, Reasons to think this could change (knowledge project #??) Could have huge impact on income inequality. 

Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants. 
   Especially now, critical to push hard on both of these.  Seems like the right has forgot   
    the former, and the left has forgot the latter.

What makes a good life ? What is the goal? 
Not hedonic happiness (HH): shouldn't expect this to be the goal. We were not selected for it.  HH is a tracer for what we were selected for. But not end in itself
If not happiness then what ?  (living according to a philosophy … ?)

Cryonics could be the most important thing you do. 
Cryonics could serve some similar function to belief in heaven for an atheist. 

Death is a puzzle to solve not some inevitable outcome to submit to.

QM is or brings, in a sense, the end of reduction-ism via entanglement.  In an entangled system, no way to reduce it to just the action of one of the spins.

“Avoid boring people, Avoid Boring you” James Watson

Someone asked Watson (or Deep-mind) what the purpose/meaning of life is, it replied
“To live forever”
Gene-level - immortality is the only goal
Human Instinct - gut reactions about avoiding death
Longevity Movement - rationally fighting against death

Work week - Interesting that in period 1870-1940 work week changed several times 12->10->8 hrs per day.  6->5 days per week.  No change in standard since.

Difference between stress and being stressed-out.
How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

"How you do everything is how you do anything"  
Counter point: Some problems are more important than others.  Resources Time/Energy finite. Need to triage. Allocate resources according to importance
Goal: First prioritize then bring the correct quantity/quality of resources to bear.n
Counter-counter point: I notice gut feeling when I cut corners (BQ!). Telling me I have probably not prioritized properly
Standard Operating system applies here (Literally HOW I do everything) 
Another pro-point: What you are currently doing could be the last thing you ever do!
On more thought, this actually seems like it cuts both ways, Do you really care how well you hung that photo if you are going to be nuked in 30s ?


Some AI thoughts
With trying to develop AI we are trying — racing— to create actual, no-bullshit Gods and almost no one is talking about it.  Its also not at all clear we will have much control over what kind of gods we create, and the consensus among experts is that it is something we are likely to do in the next 50-100 years and only get one shot at. Seems likely to lead to immortality or extinction.   

But, How much do people spend talking about the fact that soon they will spend the rest of eternity not existing ?

Related to above: How much smarter than humans can something get ? With narrow intelligence its clear there is a lot of room. General Intelligence its not obvious, eg: could asymptotic with humans being close to the max.  However even if “only” as smart as humans, AI will still be 10^6 times faster and have vast improvements in a wide range of narrow intelligence. 

AI is a tragedy of the commons: Globally want to take our time with AI (huge potential downside). Personally, (without radical longevity) I want to accelerate AU b/c the downside of not getting AI and dying is (almost certainly) the same as getting bad AI.

Like Elons response: Try to become the AI. Requires increasing bandwidth via neural-link.

Natural sources of existential threat are essentially negligible compared to the human create ones.

Interesting idea: Gene sequence any medical cases where there is illness but we cannot make a diagnosis. Would allow us to catch potential problems sooner.

Reason for optimism: We have had a radical change in our relationship/outlook toward the environment since the 60s. Might be able to do something similar for existential risk.

Thoughts about truth: 
Truth - reality / objective 
tribal truth - What your group agrees is true
Iterative truth - “git-lab” truth asymptotic to Truth

Negative Qualities:
Times when I act like I know something when I really don't
Forget what I already learned
Initial reactions to new things often biased negatively
Some people I dislike for no apparent reason
Sometimes get excited and open to many new threads

Interesting Point: 
_Slippery Slope_ problems can almost always be solved by reasonable practical judgement. 
 > Raising the speed limit by 1 mph is a slippery slope until too high, too much death. 
 > Yet we have a speed limit that is not 0 or infinity
 Should question all slippery slope arguments. 

Most important thing to learn is: We have so much to learn.  Realize this and open your mind.

Nuclear Safety

 > By far biggest problem of our time. Crazy we dont think/talk about it more. 
 > Biggest risk is accidental launch. Destroys Civilization. 
 > "All vs Nothing" approach to reductions is **wrong** way to think (but easy to get trapped by) 
 > Can make real progress by being pragmatic. 
 > eg: get rid of ICBMs - only 1st strike weapon. (and liability b/c costly  and they will be target of first strike) 
 >  get rid of presidential sole authorization - president cant go to way, but can destroy the planet) 
 > get rid of first strike

- "Minute to learn, lifetime to master" John Mayer re: guitar

- Bee sting: bodies response to the action worse than the initial attack. 

- Interesting fact: Hebrew only example of a language that died out, was dead for thousands of years then came back and now is the 1st language of millions of people.
   
- One of the best ways of talking to yourself is to talk with other people. And its important to talk to yourself to know what you think.

- Interesting Point: Assimilation  is Annihilation as far as culture is concerned. 

- Facts about Hitler: 
   > Used to have regular mustache, trimmed version was something WWI so their gas masks sealed properly. 
   > Keeping the trimmed mustache was a signal to his audience that he was a warrior and that the was still being fought.

- The holocaust is essentially/almost like a religious event. 
   > Happened seemingly out of nowhere/ taboos against asking why/how.  

- Thoughts on hiring (Jocko) 
   > Hire for capacity/raw talent NOT experience. 
   
   > Generalized skills almost always superior to specialized.

   > When recruiting for special forces, no one has experience

   > Personnel selection is Art not science
   
   > Q: "What if we train them and they leave ?" A: "What if we dont and they stay?"

   > Personnel is your biggest asset.

   > Personnel development should be your primary mission

   > "I'm just providing cover fire for my team"

   
- Thought on how to be "a man" (Jocko) 

  > Do things (Fix things/get out in nature/ etc) 

  > Learn things (Read books / develop skills) 

  > Work out (Get strong)

  > Learn how to fight (ju jitsu) 

- Humans take evolutionary path such that a lot of development happens after birth. New borns are essentially still fetuses. "Worms" that only really eat defecate, sleep and cry) 

- Cultural-level sublimation: Socially unacceptable impulses are substitute for symbolic acts. eg: head-hunting replaces ritual cannibalism replaces casual cannibalism.  
  Pinker argues  that manners and rules of high-society has a similar "taming" effect.

- Original Thinking: "Ill surely take the older well-worn path, but if I find a shorter, smoother way, Ill blaze a trail there. 
  The ones who  pioneered these paths are our guides, not our masters. Truth is open to everyone" - Seneca
  Today's conservative ideas where once controversial, cutting-edge, and innovative.

- Police Violence: Police should be allowed to use choke holds. Much safer than tasers (where head can hit ground) and much more effective if you know what your doing.

- Social media (From Social Dilemma) 
   > Lies and captures our attention for profit.
   > Creating systems that people (or governments) can use to manipulate mass populations
   > Claim: This is existential threat
   > Claim: Example of where AI is already in charge


Words that are always true and meaningful; "This too, shall pass."

- "Diversity is protection against ignorance" Diversification not good/stupid if you know what your doing. 'Just put all your money in the best companies" -Buffet. 
   Diversity is an effective hedge if you dont know whats going on, a good way to get average performance.


Compassion: (Claim) Being compassionate is good for your health. At the same level of exercising and eating right. (Skeptical)

Importance of Filtering. (Especially in today's world) Knowing what, when and how to filter is critical to being productive. Knowing what to believe, seeing truth.

Julius Caesar felt like he hadn't accomplished much (40) compared to Alexander (32)

Human Intelligence is incredibly useful, but doesn't prevent you from having false beliefs. 
That's not what intelligence is for. Intelligence is associated with coming up with more convincing bullshit and with being better liars/. 
Not the ability to recognize our own bias.  
Event worse: There is selection pressure  to be unpredictable. A great (easy) way to be unpredictable is to not know yourself. 
Evolution shields us from self-knowledge.  Minds shrouded in darkness.

Strange that the American libertarian 2nd Amendment "fire wall" types that are out to protect the constitution have aligned with the candidate that is the biggest threat to the democracy.

Markus Aurelius on Anger: Not manly to get angry. Not natural either. Better to be calm and controlled. Better to treat people with kindness. Dont go around expecting Plato's republic.  There are obstacles in the path ? Go around them. Why get angry ? Do you thing the world would notice ? or care ?

Strange how much money is in collecting data, but how little data we collect about ourselves. 

Deep Fakes: 
 - Claim: Now have better quality A/V production than Hollywood
 - How will we be able to tell whats true and false?
    - Could use high-fidelity lie detector tests. (Not clear if this is feasible/being looked into)
    - ML can try to authenticate (leads to arms race)
    - Some form of "water-marking" to guarantee authenticity
 My thoughts: Did similar issues arise with other media ? eg: faking  quotes in print ? 
   Will probably fall to content providers/eye-witnesses.

How smart/plugged-in do you need to be to properly participate in democracy? And how do these requirements change with time?
Claim: (Dan Carlin) the fraction of people that are informed enough to participate today is lower than anytime in the past.

"Ends justify the means" vs "How you play the game"
Claim: Not in our interest to have a federal policy on torture. (Even if effects, although seems it is not)
Eisenhower quote on being careful not to destroy the thing you're trying to defend from within.
Seems right to me. If we are the "home of the brave" need to sacrifice some security for our freedom.
Terrorists win if they reshape our ethics and morals by responding to thier actions.

United States has had 250 year history of becoming more democratic. 
Now elect senitors, blacks and women can vote. ect. 
Been a while since we took another step forward.
Can argue that recent gerrymandering/voter suppression is a step back. 
Covid and mail-in voting could be a step forward.

American Icebergs (via Dan Carlin):
Issues that are major problems that could destroy our country. 
Claim:  Neigher party addressing these. (Actually significatnt pressure within both parties to NOT address these)
Some radical change probably needed to make progress here.
1) Corruption too many lobbiest with too much influence to solve real problems 
   (eg: insurance companies have to "OK" health care reform)
   taints everything, all solutions to problems
2) Constitutional checks and balances
   Executive branch too much power. Nuclear Bombs, 9/11 spying, wars without congress
3) Forigen Policy: Ratcheting up tensions with Russia (Reckless) 
   Constant/Continual war on terror.
   US as "world police" citizens dont want it. 
4) US middle class jobs disappearing. Middle class is the balast of society. 
   How to cope when/if foundation shaken/broken? 

Better to trip with your feet that with your words. Better to screw up doing than saying.
That which is done can be undone, that which is said cannot be unsaid.


The work of living is to set STANDARDs and to live by them. Dont comrimise. 
Judge all you say, do, and the opinions you hold by your standards.  "Are these consistent with my beliefs?" "Are these what the persion I want to be would do?"
