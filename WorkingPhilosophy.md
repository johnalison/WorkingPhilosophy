How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

Purpose of philosophy not to achieve some perfect ideal, but to keep becoming more complete, more happy, more “X and happy” where x = { sick, in danger, disgraced, etc} Philosophy should keep the well-being independent from the x, which is largely out of our control. 

[Random Interesting thoughts](#Random-Interesting-thoughts)

# Moral duty to become more rational.

- Learn from others mistakes
- Critical to look at things from as many different angles as possible.
    Good things: think about what could have gone differently. What was luck ? What good 
                          Planning?
     Bad things: Think how much worse it could have been. What was luck ? What bad  
                           Planning?
- Look at desires for what they are: A response of an algorithm trained 50k years ago in a   
  different environment. 
- Learn how to learn from those you disagree with  or even offend you. See if you can find the   
    “truth” in what they believe.  - Kevin Kelly
- “When you fall, pick something up”
- We are all biased even when/if we don't think we are.
> Eg: 
> Q: Who is the best/smartest person you work with?
> A: “The one who agrees with me most often is X”
> Most people unlikely to think highly of anyone whose view opposes your own. 
> Strive to recognize and reduce this bias.
> Try to use EQ/BQ to see where/when I have gut reaction to something, can check that for bias
 - Moderate positive reactions to “good luck”. See where it could have failed. What could have been improved. 

- whatever happens, no matter how bad have a way of looking/thinking about the situation to improve.

- See the role model in everyone.
  Important to try to emulate you want to be. 
  Role models can be amagamations of people.
  Look for qualities that you want to emulate in other people, even if you dont want to be like the person.

- Make yourself dependable. 
  Deserve the things you want. 
  Its more important to deserve the things you wan than to have them.

- Try to maintain objectivity
> Automate good techinques: use check lists/protocols ect


# You are what you think, but with practice, you can change what you think

- Perfection not required
- Begin Again
- Important truth that most people don't know/realize 
- Take the day a moment at a time. No need to rush into it, to rush to the next moment. The day will arrive anyway all on its own.
- Meditation:
-  Fundamentally empirical exercise. 
- Asks; What is the mind like when it is doing nothing but noticing whatever is in the 
  stream of consciousness?
What is it like right now?
- We are our habitual thoughts
- Being mindful of thinking and emotion is the gateway to psychological well-being. (via Sam Harris) 
- "Where is the self if every sign of it is appearing in consciousness?" (via waking up)
   > Self is supposed to be the thing that is conscious. However only sign of the self is in consciousness.
- Emotion is the enemy, do whatever you can to take emotion out of the equation. 
- Mind as an enemy
   - Used to thinking of our minds as our allies
   - However in reality, minds are prone to laziness/want to believe a good story/dont want to be challenged/ etc
   - It is *reason* that is our ally and is needed to keep our minds in check/unbiased.  
- "Fear is the bodies preparation for action. 
  Fear does things behind the scenes to get you physically ready. 
  Knowing that this is happening and feeling it work, can help prepare the mind, prevent it from startling" 
  (From Pscycology of the fighting man)




# Strict with yourself, Lenient with others

Poor Richard: Neglect kills injuries, Revenge increases them
Need more forgiveness -> forgiveness is transcendence (transcends human nature) 
   (Good for mind / Good for future self)


# You can only control what you can control

- Respond don't react
- I am the only one whose opinion really matters. I am the one who sets the standard. Use criticism/praise for what its worth, but don't look too much into it.
- Happiness, peace, stillness, well-being come from within.
- Only your choices are good or evil. Everything else just happens.
- No point being upset with what happens.  Don't take it personally. Remove emotional coloring. 



# Don't Lie!

Poor Richards Almanac: 
  “Keep conscience clean, then never fear”

“The foundation of morality is to have done away, once and for all, with lying”
               - Thomas Huxley

"Be Reliable": Unreliability will cancel out all other virtues.  
How can can I be more reliable ? 
Say what you mean, mean what you say.
Say what you do, do what you say.



# Be the good: Intelligent ACTION is power

- To get what you want, deserve what you want - Charlie Munger

- “The great end of life is not knowledge, but action” - Thomas Huxley

- “Only thing that matters is doing the right thing right now. 

   > Past cannot be changed

   > Future is no assured 

   > The action in the present should be “right”
   
- “The used key is always bright” - Poor Richard

- “Not enough to think or say the right things, you have to act on them” - Shane Parish

- Stop thinking about what a good person is/does and be one.

- "Can get substantial improvement by deciding to be a better person. 
   Look around and see what traits you admire in others and then copy them. 
   Can lead to lasting, significant improvement."  - Warren Buffet

- Want some good ? Get it for yourself.  To have a good day, do good things

- Ideology is viral, Pragmatism is functional. 
  Pragmatism is what needs to be embraced in order to do.  
  Always look for the pragmatic over the Ideological 

- Today is the day, now is the time. This is when/how progress gets made. Live by doing. Do by focusing fully on the current task at hand.
   (See Standard Operating System)

- "Blow your own nose!" 
   You can sit there praying your nose wont run or wait for someone else to come along and wipe it. 
   Or you can blow your own nose, that's what you have hands for.

# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 
  No need to get emotional about these external events. 
  They, the external events, don't care about you. 
  You need to respond to the situation that has presented itself. 
  Emotional reactions only add your suffering and limit the scope of your response. 
  Use glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction. 


# Memento Mori: All we have is time; lack of attention throws it away

- Death always with us, dying moment at a time.
 Important that death and its possibility color your life.

- Fight Club:  You always have a gun to your head: Need to make decisions have personal interactions with this in mind.

- **Alive time vs Dead time:**
  
   > You don't own anything! Anything you think you own goes away when you die, and you don't know when that is going to happen. Could be tomorrow or tonight. The only one thing that is yours , that you cant be taken away from you is time.  Guard and Value it with the respect it deserves.  It's all you have...

- Time is constantly running out, don't know how much you got

- Dont worry/think about things you dont like. No point looking down on someone or something that you dont like or find interesting. Move on, drop it. There is only so much time and energy (via Joe Rogan)

- Time is all you have. No one can take it from you. But you can throw it away from lack of attention if you are careless / not mindful. 

- **Attention:**

   > Attention is a finite resource 
   > Is the bricks and mortar of our life
   > Amazing how easily we let it be stolen from us

- Should live more as if you had been diagnosed with some terminal disease and were going to die soon.  In fact we all have a terminal disease: “The cause of death is birth” and we don't know how much longer we have to live. 

- “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think”
     Markus Aurelius
  Put everything that takes time or attention, costs money, or takes sacrifice through this filter.  


# Respond, don't React (Stoic Test Strategy) 

- Anger/ Losing temper is never good, never improves the situation. Always best to “observe” the anger, Reflect then respond. Response always superior to reaction. Reaction is the embodiment of anger

- Poor Richards Almanac: “He who can compose himself is wiser than he who composes books”
  
- Getting angry never makes things better. To deal with stress need to get perspective (zoom way in or zoom way out). Return to the present moment. Accept the obstacle. (via Marcus Aurelius)  

- Dont make things worse: When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. 
  Practically means that anger, action without plan (aka reaction) doesnt help, it hurts. 
  Remove emotion and make a plan (aka respond)

# Systems Not Goals

- Habits compound interest of self improvement
- ceiling set by Goals, floor set by system
- Google 20%
- Improve ability to learn new things
- Practice is the key 
- Goal oriented vs Growth oriented 
  - In long run, growth is much more important that weather a particular goal was reached
Growth:  
Cumulative
Can improve even if goal fails
Strategy for long-term success (biggest/most-of-the payoff at the end)
(Event if you only care about goals, growth enables them!


- “You don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level  of you systems”  James Clever
   Idea: Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement
  - Seems insignificant at first
  - All payout back-loaded
- “You are what you consistently do” - Aristotle via Shane Parish 
- “Purpose of habit is to remove self-negotiation” - Kevin Kelly

Role of Failure:  (Bill Ackmann)
Success is not a straight line
Successful people have to deal with hardship
How successful you are is a function of how you deal with failure.
If you deal with failure well and persist, you have a high probability of being successful

- If you want to do something, make a habit of it

      - Systems and Habits
      - Sleep 8 yrs/night
      - Low carb
      - Time restricted Feeding
      - Meditate
      - Exercise
      - Stuff capture / Next action
      - Journaling
      - Read

- How to act; how to figure out what to do. 
  Two simple (but not easy) steps: 

   1. Dont get upset 
       * Removes bias.
       * What happened had to, given what came before.
   
   2. Remember your values: principle and purpose
       * Eliminates the obviously wrong options/choices.
       * Choose from whats left

- What are my values?
   - Dont Lie
   - Look for lasting change (systems not goals) 
   - Golden rule (veil of ignorance) 
   - Strict with self/lenient with other
   - Increase freedom/liberty when possible
   - Equality of opportunity
   - ...

- "Coming back to a habit is the most powerful habit of all"
  > Having the right habits are critical: Having habit to form/continue habits. Habit of self-improvement. (these are like wishes for more wishes)
  
- Ideas for daily habits:
   - Single-tasking session: work on something for XX minutes with no distractions. 
   - Daily gratitude: What have you done well ? What love about yourself/others ? 

- Progress does not come from one big show of force.  
  Real, true, lasting progress comes from grinding things out. 

- When things are going bad Bad ... "Good"
  When things arent going as expected ... "Good"
  Whey you dont get the promotion ... "Good"
  "Good" for resetting the frame of mind. Allows you to focus on the upside of any situation.


# Perfection Not required, effective self-improvement critical 

- Seek out feedback loops: these give an easy path to self-improvement. However its important that the noise is low (eg: poker not for decision theory). Would like to put this to use with glimpses/mindfulness.

- If you need to specialize,  should specialize in being the best version of yourself. Much better/more-productive than some esoteric or politics or sports trivia.  Positive feedback loop

- Inch-by-inch progress is made. 
“Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is no small thing” - Zeno
Related is concept of compounding interest
Get better at getting better. 

- “Begin Again” - Important skill that is underappreciated, Under-utilized. Useful as a mantra anytime there is a daunting task.

- Think of life as one long training/learning period.  Use life as a “sparing partner” that we are using to improve. It is important to be clear minded and respond to what is happening, but no need to take it personally. 

- Example: The American experiment. Country far from perfect when started (deeply flawed) with time the notion of citizen improved/expanded to be "more perfect".

- Anti-fragility:
Something is fragile if it easily breaks, robust if it does not break under stress, and anti-fragile if it gets stronger or improves under stress. 
Lots of stoic thoughts about how to improve under stress. 
Important to be able to try many low cost experiments and iterate. 
Think about what makes you anti-fragile. and where and how you can fail. 
How can you optimize worse case scenarios? 

- Law of diminishing returns 
   - Example of 80/20 
   - Get the low hanging fruit
   - Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
   - Then choose what long sloughs to fith. 

# Do not let your happiness (well-being) depend on things you cannot control

Explains how people can be well-off an miserable or poor and happy
Make Well-being depend only on things you can control
Focus more on wanting what you have  
Rejoice in your actions that lead to good outcomes
Escape within: Possible way to derive happiness. 
Meditation: Observing the mind
Headless way: Focusing on 1st person perspective
Study 
Work
- Stop caring what other people think. Focus on what you think is good, is just ect. Cant let other peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work)  validate or bring you meaning. 
   Meaning must come from within. 

# Leadership is a skill that can be taught/learned

- How do you become a better leader ? 
   >   - Listen to people
   >   - Avoid ideology 

- Leadership Tactic: Detach
  
   - Can often see correct path forward with some distance.
   - *Big Question* How do you remember to detach ? 
       > Partial Answer: Use body signals to measure monitor when you are caught up. 
       > eg: when you are getting angry/emotional clenching your jaw/fists (BQ!)
       > This indicates you are caught up in a probable/overly focused.
   - To detach, consciously send signals to you body: Lift head/chip up. Scan room from left to right. Breath. 
   - Gives you perspective/space to think.


# Random Interesting thoughts


- "Leader on the front lines is always right". Even if what they are saying seems counter-intuitive, there is some truth to their lived experience.


- Importance of finding clarity:  
   Need clarity on:
     -  meaning/mission of life. 
     -  what your building to day-in/day-out
     - How to improve relationships

- "Tool worship is not art" Richard Heart 
   People often focus too much on the quality of the tools and less on what you make with them.

- "Only the tail events matter"
   Heard this in the context of investing: "99% of the economy in with +/- 2 sigma of the models/expectation and only the 1% on the tails matter"
   People sweating what 0.5% raise in interest rate would do and all of the sudden we get slammed with 20% unemployment. 

- You get what you reward for. (Big lesson from Biology) 

   - Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. LIST  In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 
   -  Do what is essential. 
       - Richard Heart “If youse been doing something for a while and it docent change your life (ie: what you do/think/believe), Why are you doing it ?”...Go do push-ups

“Waste no time or Energy on grudges” Churchill 

“Whats the next action?” Philosophy seems to be practical/effective and clarifying. 

Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

Can satiate desire by thinking-about  or being-aware-of desire. Don't necessarily have to indulge the desire. 

Mathematics used to have long standing unsolved problems ~100 years ago
   Riemann Hyp/ Fermat's Last theorem/ Continuum Hyphothese / Four color problem
3 of these have been solved, but in very non-traditional ways. 

Monster group: has as many elements as there are particles in Jupiter!! Whats it for  ? Why here ?

Potential in capitalism at the local level (eg: apparently now illegal for regular people to invest in start-ups, Reasons to think this could change (knowledge project #??) Could have huge impact on income inequality. 

Poor Richards Almanac: 
   “No ugly lovers, no handsome prisons” 
   “Speak with contempt of non, from slave to king
    The smallest bee has, (and will use) a sting”

Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants. 
   Especially now, critical to push hard on both of these.  Seems like the right has forgot   
    the former, and the left has forgot the latter.

Need to tolerate both types of errors: 
    Type1 : “letting the bad in”
     Type2: “kicking the good out”  
  You are unlikely to be optimal unless you have some tolerance of both

What makes a good life ? What is the goal? 
Not hedonic happiness (HH): shouldn't expect this to be the goal. We were not selected for it.  HH is a tracer for what we were selected for. But not end in itself
If not happiness then what ?  (living according to a philosophy … ?)

Cryonics could be the most important thing you do. 

Death is a puzzle to solve not some inevitable outcome to submit to.

Cryonics could serve some similar function to belief in heaven for an atheist. 

QM is or brings, in a sense, the end of reduction-ism via entanglement.  In an entangled system, no way to reduce it to just the action of one of the spins.

“Avoid boring people, Avoid Boring you” James Watson

Someone asked Watson (or Deepmind) what the purpose/meaning of life is, it replied
“To live forever”
Gene-level - immortality is the only goal
Human Instinct - gut reactions about avoiding death
Longevity Movement - rationally fighting against death

How do you know you're not a brain in a vat?  Turns outs, you are a brain in a vat! 
Everything you are, think, see, feel is electrical signals.  - Elon Musk

Work week - Interesting that in period 1870-1940 work week changed several times 12->10->8 hrs per day.  6->5 days per week.  No change in standard since.

Difference between stress and being stressed-out.
How to live with stress and not be stressed out is a major goal of Philosophy 

"How you do everything is how you do anything"  
Counter point: Some problems are more important than others.  Resources Time/Energy finite. Need to triage. Allocate resources according to importance
Goal: First prioritize then bring the correct quantity/quality of resources to bear.n
Counter-counter point: I notice gut feeling when I cut corners (BQ!). Telling me I have probably not prioritized properly
Standard Operating system applies here (Literally HOW I do everything) 
Another pro-point: What you are currently doing could be the last thing you ever do!
On more thought, this actually seems like it cuts both ways, Do you really care how well you hung that photo if you are going to be nuked in 30s ?

Standard Operating system: 
- Getting things done: art of stress-free productivity.  (David Allen) 
- Same method advocated by Zen Habits
- Basically: Write everything down, make a list, triage, focus entirely on one thing at a time.
- More detail
  > Start of the day: scan projects, come up with next actions
  
  > work mode: Pull from next actions 
  
  > Suff list: as thing occur to me write them in inbox. 

What is Wisdom? 
"Noticing the causes of psychological suffering, noticing where they are unnecessary and then stop doing the things that are producing needless suffering"
- Sam Harris) 



Some AI thoughts
With trying to develop AI we are trying — racing— to create actual, no-bullshit Gods and almost no one is talking about it.  Its also not at all clear we will have much control over what kind of gods we create, and the consensus among experts is that it is something we are likely to do in the next 50-100 years and only get one shot at. Seems likely to lead to immortality or extinction.   

But, How much do people spend talking about the fact that soon they will spend the rest of eternity not existing ?

Related to above: How much smarter than humans can something get ? With narrow intelligence its clear there is a lot of room. General Intelligence its not obvious, eg: could asymptotic with humans being close to the max.  However even if “only” as smart as humans, AI will still be 10^6 times faster and have vast improvements in a wide range of narrow intelligence. 

AI is a tragedy of the commons: Globally want to take our time with AI (huge potential downside). Personally, (without radical longevity) I want to accelerate AU b/c the downside of not getting AI and dying is (almost certainly) the same as getting bad AI.

Like Elons response: Try to become the AI. Requires increasing bandwidth via neurallink.




Thoughts about truth: 
Truth - reality / objective 
tribal truth - What your group agrees is true
Iterative truth - “git-lab” truth asymptotes to Truth

Negative Qualities:
Times when I act like I know something when I really don't
Forget what I already learned
Initial reactions to new things often biased negatively
Some people I dislike for no apparent reason
Sometimes get excited and open to many new threads




North Stars : 
Karol Krizka: has the nature that when something comes up (no matter how big or small) he digs deeply to the root cause to fix or improve the problem. Was especially apparent to me when working with him on FTK commissioning. Leeds to deep knowledge in various areas that are likely to come up again. Builds expertise in debugging technical problems (motivates the building of a Linux machine). Example of compounding returns.
"How you do everything is how you do anything"  



Mental models:

### "The map is not the territory" 
  - Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model
  - Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information
  - Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
  - Physics Examples: EFTs

### Law of diminishing returns
   - Example of 80/20 
   - Get the low hanging fruit
   - Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
   - Then choose what long sloughs to fith.
