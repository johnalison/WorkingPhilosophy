# Don't Lie! (Evil only possible through lies)

- “Keep conscience clean, then never fear”  - Poor Richards Almanac

- “The foundation of morality is to have done away, once and for all, with lying” - Thomas Huxley
   

- "Be Reliable": Unreliability will cancel out all other virtues.  

- How can I be more reliable ? 
  > Say what you mean, mean what you say.
  > Say what you do, do what you say.

- Dont cheat, dont mislead, dont talk behind others backs, dont act sneaky, dont avoid doing things you should or need to do

- Character is the only thing that matters. Character determines your fate. Character can never be taken away from you. 

  > Building character is one of the only important projects in life
  > Focus on character and the rest will fall into place.

- Honest as default

  > Something rotten and fraudulent when people say, "Im going to give
    it to you straight" or "Let me be honest", "Heres what I really
    feel" ect.  Always be the person who gives it straight. Wear it on
    your sleeve. Let it shine through all you do.
