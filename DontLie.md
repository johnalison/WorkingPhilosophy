# Don't Lie! (Evil only possible through lies)

- “Keep conscience clean, then never fear” 
  > Poor Richards Almanac

- “The foundation of morality is to have done away, once and for all, with lying”
  > Thomas Huxley

- "Be Reliable": Unreliability will cancel out all other virtues.  

- How can I be more reliable ? 
  > Say what you mean, mean what you say.
  > Say what you do, do what you say.

- Dont cheat, dont mislead, dont talk behind others backs, dont act sneaky, dont avoid doing things you should or need to do

- Character is the only thing that matters. Character determines your fate. Character can never be taken away from you. 
  > Building character is one of the only important projects in life
  > Focus on character and the rest will fall into place.
