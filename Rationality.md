# Moral duty to become more rational.

- Learn from others mistakes

- Critical to look at things from as many different angles as possible.

   Good things: think about what could have gone differently. What was luck ? What good Planning?
                          
   Bad things: Think how much worse it could have been. What was luck ? What bad Planning?
   
                           
- Look at desires for what they are: A response of an algorithm trained 50k years ago in a different environment. 
  
- Learn how to learn from those you disagree with  or even offend you. See if you can find the   
    “truth” in what they believe.  - Kevin Kelly
- “When you fall, pick something up”
- We are all biased even when/if we don't think we are.

   > Eg: 
   > Q: Who is the best/smartest person you work with?
   > A: “The one who agrees with me most often is X”
   > Most people unlikely to think highly of anyone whose view opposes your own. 
   > Strive to recognize and reduce this bias.
   > Try to use EQ/BQ to see where/when I have gut reaction to something, can check that for bias
   
- Moderate positive reactions to “good luck”. See where it could have failed. What could have been improved. 

- Whatever happens, no matter how bad have a way of looking/thinking about the situation to improve.

- See the role model in everyone.
  Important to try to emulate you want to be. 
  Role models can be amalgamations of people.
  Look for qualities that you want to emulate in other people, even if you dont want to be like the person.

- Make yourself dependable. 
  Deserve the things you want. 
  Its more important to deserve the things you wan than to have them.

- Try to maintain objectivity
    > Automate good techniques: use check lists/protocols ect

- Need to tolerate both types of errors: 

   Type1 : “letting the bad in”
   Type2: “kicking the good out”  

 You are unlikely to be optimal unless you have some tolerance of both

- Want to be a learn-it-all not a know-it-all
   > Humility is the key to growth and leadership.  Stay humble and see what you can learn.

- "Dont sweat the small stuff" good Stoic advice. 
   When you spend time and energy on things that dont matter, you are making them matter. 
   This changes how you live your life, who your are. 
   You are what you repeatedly do. 
   Dont be something you dont want to be.

- Pillage from all sources 
  "Never be ashamed to quote a bad writer with a good saying" -Seneca
  Look for wisdom independent of where it comes from. 

- The art of having no opinion
  > Mechanism for suppressing innate bias
  > Most opinions are reactionary and unrelated to whats really happening
  > Definitely true of today's politics. Different sides have opinions that are really reactions based on their current stance/posture.
  > Becoming and independent/orthogonal rational thinker requires suppression of reactionary positions/thoughts
