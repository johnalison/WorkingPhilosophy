  >Focus on what you think is good, is just etc. Cant let other
   peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work) validate or bring
   you meaning.  Meaning must come from within.

- Stoic way to pray: Instead of asking/hoping for something to happen, ask for the strength to overcome it when it doesn't happen.

- Dont need a reason to be happy or tranquil.
   > You know what its like to be in that state, just do it. If you still need a reason: You're not dead yet, still in the game.
