  >Focus on what you think is good, is just etc. Cant let other
   peoples opinion of you ( acceptance of your work) validate or bring
   you meaning.  Meaning must come from within.

- To chase external approval and validation is to chase an illusion.
   > A chimera constructed (for good reason) by Biology and Culture.  

- Stoic way to pray: Instead of asking/hoping for something to happen, ask for the strength to overcome it when it doesn't happen.

- Dont need a reason to be happy or tranquil.
   > You know what its like to be in that state, just do it. If you still need a reason: You're not dead yet, still in the game.

- We havent evolved to be happy.

- Wisdom is the realizeation that you can have happiness without reaching any goal or acomplishing some big achievement.

  > What if what is present right now, on the path of living your life
    was all there was ? Could you be happy? Happy on the journey ?
    Through meditation you can realize that you can. You also realize,
    upon reflection, that this is really all there is.
