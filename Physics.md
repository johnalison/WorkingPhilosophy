# Weinberg on EFTs

   - Dont have to posit that the cannonical formalism is correct.
   - Explains why we only consider renormalizible operators, all the others are there, but they are suppressed
   - Lepton violation (nu-oscillations) first sign of higher dim operators for SM
   - Baryon Number violation the next that should be seen (claim that the matter-antimatter asymmetry => it is likely there)


# Frack Wilczek

  - Strong Circumstantial evidence for GUTs:
  - All gauge forces.  Speack similar language
  - Couplings appear to unify (esp. with SUSY)
  - Matter feilds and Quantum numbers fit into larger multiplets (highly non-trivial)
  - Expect nu-masses (seen) / p-decay (Not yet completely excluded) / SUSY
