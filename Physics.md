# Weinberg on EFTs

   - Dont have to posit that the cannonical formalism is correct.
   - Explains why we only consider renormalizible operators, all the others are there, but they are suppressed
   - Lepton violation (nu-oscillations) first sign of higher dim operators for SM
   - Baryon Number violation the next that should be seen (claim that the matter-antimatter asymmetry => it is likely there)


# Frack Wilczek

  - Strong Circumstantial evidence for GUTs:
  - All gauge forces.  Speack similar language
  - Couplings appear to unify (esp. with SUSY)
  - Matter feilds and Quantum numbers fit into larger multiplets (highly non-trivial)
  - Expect nu-masses (seen) / p-decay (Not yet completely excluded) / SUSY
  - Big bang makes a preffered coodinate frame
     - Large scale structure homogeneous/isotropic in this frame
     - This is why we can assign well-defined ages cosmologically
  - Interesting take on QM interpretations:
     "We have the laws, they are deterministic, we just dont know (and fundamentally cant know) the wave function"
  - re:Block Universe: The laws of physics arent formulated so thaty naturally describe the entire Space-time manifold all at once.
     Natural description is of one slice and then how that slice changes forward and backward in time. 

- Degrees of freedom are finite whenever you include gravity.  (See "no local variables")

- Classical vs Intiutionist Mathematics
   -) Classical Mathematics: You have block universe: All information at a time slice. (Can be specified infinite past/past/ present of furture)
   -) Intuitionist Mathematics: Real numbers are a process. Information increases with time.
  Claim: "All of physics can be done with intuitionist mathematics"

- g-2 discrepancy larger than W/Z contribution

- How could you prove the world was determinsitic?
   - deomonstrate in simple systems
   - Show that the laws (theory) predict the outcome
   - Then assume that the theory applies to more complicated systems
   - Determinism is a property of the theory (map), not (?) the world (territory).
   - chaos => need real numbers infinite percision.
   - determism is the statement that initial conditions predict all future behaviour
   - Seems like you have to prove that a theory is deterministic and then claim that the theory applies to the world.
