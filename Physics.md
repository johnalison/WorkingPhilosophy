# Weinberg on EFTs

   - Dont have to posit that the cannonical formalism is correct.
   - Explains why we only consider renormalizible operators, all the others are there, but they are suppressed
   - Lepton violation (nu-oscillations) first sign of higher dim operators for SM
   - Baryon Number violation the next that should be seen (claim that the matter-antimatter asymmetry => it is likely there)


# Frack Wilczek

  - Strong Circumstantial evidence for GUTs:
  - All gauge forces.  Speack similar language
  - Couplings appear to unify (esp. with SUSY)
  - Matter feilds and Quantum numbers fit into larger multiplets (highly non-trivial)
  - Expect nu-masses (seen) / p-decay (Not yet completely excluded) / SUSY
  - Big bang makes a preffered coodinate frame
     - Large scale structure homogeneous/isotropic in this frame
     - This is why we can assign well-defined ages cosmologically
  - Interesting take on QM interpretations:
     "We have the laws, they are deterministic, we just dont know (and fundamentally cant know) the wave function"
  - re:Block Universe: The laws of physics arent formulated so thaty naturally describe the entire Space-time manifold all at once.
     Natural description is of one slice and then how that slice changes forward and backward in time. 

- Degrees of freedom are finite whenever you include gravity.  (See "no local variables")

- Classical vs Intiutionist Mathematics
   -) Classical Mathematics: You have block universe: All information at a time slice. (Can be specified infinite past/past/ present of furture)
   -) Intuitionist Mathematics: Real numbers are a process. Information increases with time.
  Claim: "All of physics can be done with intuitionist mathematics"

- g-2 discrepancy larger than W/Z contribution

- The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realized how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress.


- There are some Netrual Mesons live long enoug to transform into thier anti-particles
   D(uc)
   K(sd) / B(bd) / B_S(bs)
   Note pi0 is its own anti-paticle. ditto (phi/jpsi/upsilon)
