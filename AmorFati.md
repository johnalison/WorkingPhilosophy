# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 

  > No need to get emotional about these external events.  They, the
  > external events, don't care about you.  You need to respond to the
  > situation that has presented itself.  Emotional reactions only add
  > your suffering and limit the scope of your response.  Use
  > glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction.

- Be the calm. Calm is contagious. 
  > Need to do more thinking before speaking.


- Reverence and Justice:
   > Leave the past behind, let fate deal with the future. Focus on Now, the present and be guided by

   > _Reverence_: love what you have been given (love what happends) Amore Fati

   > and

   > _Justice_ Speak truth freely without aversion.


- Live without fear, live without hope. Realize that you are totally free in this moment, whatever happens.

  > Hops is a disguised form of fear or of suffering


- Accept sucess without arrogance, let failure go with indifference.

  > Sucess and failure are impostors, what really matters is **who we are**
