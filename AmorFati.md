# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 

  > No need to get emotional about these external events.  They, the
  > external events, don't care about you.  You need to respond to the
  > situation that has presented itself.  Emotional reactions only add
  > your suffering and limit the scope of your response.  Use
  > glimpses/mindfulness to catch/mute the reaction.

- Be the calm. Calm is contagious. 
  > Need to do more thinking before speaking.


- Reverence and Justice:
   > Leave the past behind, let fate deal with the future. Focus on Now, the present and be guided by

   > _Reverence_: love what you have been given (love what happends) Amore Fati

   > and

   > _Justice_ Speak truth freely without aversion.


- Live without fear, live without hope. Realize that you are totally free in this moment, whatever happens.

  > Hops is a disguised form of fear or of suffering


- Accept sucess without arrogance, let failure go with indifference.

  > Sucess and failure are impostors, what really matters is **who we are**

- The art of acquiesces: if something happens that you did not wish to happen, CHANGE YOUR WISH and accept what happened.

- You cannot alter the past, but you can also not make the future other than it will be. (Russell)

- Obviously you can have no effect on the past. But this does not mean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes had been different. Our present wishes are conditioned by the past and therefore could not be different unless the past was different. The past cannot be different from what it was , but no more can our present wishes be different from what they are. (Russell)
