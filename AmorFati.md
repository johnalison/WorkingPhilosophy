# Amor Fati: Embrace what happens, it couldn't have been otherwise.

- Need to embrace what happens.

- You don't control what happens externally to you. You are only responsible for you choices/actions. 

  > No need to get emotional about these external events.  They, the

   > _Reverence_: love what you have been given (love what happends) Amore Fati

   > and

   > _Justice_ Speak truth freely without aversion.
