- Embarking on a Thermal Journey in Low Dimensions with a 21C Thermometer: Graphene Nonlocal Noise

- Nano-Thremometers based on ??? Noise .

- Talk about thermal transport.

- "Quantum Material" Band theory breaks down

- Thermal transport counts DoF, idependenlty of the statistics.
    Want electron transsport not phonon transport.

- Why is low D thermal transport hard?

- Hard to isolate electron contribution. Can do it with Graphine non-local noise.

...Now lost...

.. The rest not great...

Good speaker.
