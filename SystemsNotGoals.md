- Ceiling set by Goals, floor set by system

- Google 20%

- Improve ability to learn new things
- Practice is the key 
- Goal oriented vs Growth oriented 
  - In long run, growth is much more important that weather a particular goal was reached
- Growth:  
 > Cumulative
 > Can improve even if goal fails.
 > Strategy for long-term success (biggest/most-of-the payoff at the end)
 > (Event if you only care about goals, growth enables them!
- “You don't rise to the level of you goals, you fall to the level  of you systems”  James Clever
   Idea: Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement
  - Seems insignificant at first
  - All payout back-loaded
- “You are what you consistently do” - Aristotle via Shane Parish 
- “Purpose of habit is to remove self-negotiation” - Kevin Kelly

- Role of Failure:  (Bill Ackmann)
 > Success is not a straight line

 > Successful people have to deal with hardship

 > How successful you are is a function of how you deal with failure.

 > If you deal with failure well and persist, you have a high probability of being successful

- If you want to do something, make a habit of it

      - Sleep 8 yrs/night
      - Low carb
      - Time restricted Feeding

- How to act; how to figure out what to do. 
  Two simple (but not easy) steps: 

   1. Dont get upset 
       * Removes bias.
       * What happened had to, given what came before.
   
   2. Remember your values: principle and purpose
       * Eliminates the obviously wrong options/choices.
       * Choose from whats left

- What are my values?
   - Dont Lie
   - Look for lasting change (systems not goals) 
   - Golden rule (veil of ignorance) 
   - Strict with self/lenient with other
   - Increase freedom/liberty when possible
   - Equality of opportunity
   - ...

- "Coming back to a habit is the most powerful habit of all"
  > Having the right habits are critical: Having habit to form/continue habits. Habit of self-improvement. (these are like wishes for more wishes)
  
- Ideas for daily habits:
   - Single-tasking session: work on something for XX minutes with no distractions. 
   - Daily gratitude: What have you done well ? What love about yourself/others ? 

- Progress does not come from one big show of force.  
  Real, true, lasting progress comes from grinding things out. 

- When things are going bad ... "Good"
  When things aren't going as expected ... "Good"
  Whey you dont get the promotion ... "Good"
  "Good" for resetting the frame of mind. Allows you to focus on the upside of any situation.

- **Focus on the present** Easy to get bogged down by the big picture. 
  This is really where __the operating system__ comes in. 
  Map out the big picture (ie: Zoom out), then focus on what the *next steps are* (ie: Zoom in). 
  Then readdress the Big picture as needed.

- Education and Stoicism are ongoing processes. Wisdom is pursued; it is not conferred/obtained/received.  You have not graduated. School is for life. 

- "Going through the motions" is a trick that allows you to overcome weakness on day when you are "not feeling it".

- How to push yourself (via Jocko)
  Need to balance emotion and logic to get more from yourself. When emotions are telling you to quit analyze them rationally (where do they come from ? Algorithms for ancient environment)  
  When logic is telling you to stop trying, turn-on emotion. 

- "Biggest generator of long-term results is learning to do things when you dont feel like doing them" - Shane parish

- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. 

- Plan to decisive Points
  > interesting strategy in military planning. 
  > Do not plan to achieve the objective directly. 
  > Plan to the "decisive point" which is the point after which you have a decisive advantage and clear path to victory.
  > eg: if your a strong grappler in a fight, your decisive point would be to get on the ground.

- Once the situation is upon you its too late.
  > you have to be prepared in advance. 
  > You need to know already who you are and what you believe. 
  > Not what you organization believes, not what your peers believe.
  > They way to do it is by working through issues of morality/mortality/ and honor for YOURSELF. 

- Habbit Dip: 
  > You'll always hit a dip in energy/motivation (Thats the bad news) 
  > The good news: Dips are temporary, provide and opportunity to learn.

  > "Learn the Dip" Learn how to face difficulty, let go of the ideal, deal with frustration. 

  > Critical to come into dip with learning mindset. Less idealistic, more curiosity. USE MINDFULNESS!

## Standard Operating system: 
- Getting things done: art of stress-free productivity.  (David Allen) 
- Same method advocated by Zen Habits
- Basically: Write everything down, make a list, triage, focus entirely on one thing at a time.
- More detail
  > Start of the day: scan projects, come up with next actions
  
  > work mode: Pull from next actions 
  
  > Stuff list: as thing occur to me write them in inbox. 

- Daily routine: 
  > List of 3 main things to do and 2-3 minor things

  > Focus entirely on one of the top 3 until finished/stalled
  
  > Move on to the next until done

  > Select from next actions list
