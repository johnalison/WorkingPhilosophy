-  Marcus Aurelius, frustrated with some obnoxious thing that was consuming his days, once asked himself.
    “You’re afraid of death, because you won’t be able to do this anymore?”
    Because death is real. You do not have unlimited time.

- it is unconscionable to fill up body bags while you get your education one mistake at a time
  Jim Mattis
