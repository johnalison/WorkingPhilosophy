# The Road to Reality (Roger Penrose)

   - "3 mysteries of reality" (biggest take away) 
      Idea: the physical world can be described by (is contained in) the mathematical world. 
      The mathematical world can be entirely discovered (?) (understood) by the mental world.
      The  mental world (consciousness) is entirely a product of the physical world. 
      Nested loop. 

   - Interesting take on particle physics "zig-zag" model of electron interactions.
 
   - Interesting discussion of Cantor's theory of the infinite and Godel's incompleteness theorem.
       (Want to read the emperors new mind

   - Good take on problems with QM



# Fight Club (Cluck Palahniuk)

  - Story about awakening.
  - Character study of an person going insane
  - Looking for something to live for.
  - Paraphrasing: "Life starts when you know you are going to die."
  - "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."
  - "This is your life and its ending one minute at a time."
  - Explicit connections: w/Buddhism some connections with Stoicism
  - Keeping personal burial money on hand (Monento Mori)

# Rise and Fall of American Growth (Robert Gordon)
  - Point that a log of growth has come from things that can only happen once: install plumbing / cure infectious diseases / ect.
  - Now in position where growth really only happening in one, small sector (IT)
  - Points out a lot of problems that will slow growth in next decades: Inequality / Education / Grov. Debt / Income Inequality

# Breakfast of Champions (Kurt Vonnegut)
- Didn't really get it. Was obviously a lot of cleaver stuff going on, most of it was over my head. 
- "I thank those lusts (of gold and seeing little girls underpants) for being so ridiculous for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything"
- "Ideas on earth were badges of friendship. Friends agreed with friends to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with  enemies in order to express enmity."
- "Seems like the only kind of job an American can get these days is committing suicide in some way"
- I wont know myself until I find out whether life is serious or not"



# Poor Richards Almanac (Ben Franklin)
- "No ugly lovers, no handsome prisons"
- "Speak with contempt of non, from slave to king. The smallest bee has, (and will use) a sting"
  

# Stoic Test Challenge (William Ivine)
- Great Book!
- Definetly changed my life for the better. 
- Philosophy of life: what in life is worth having and what is a strategy for obtaining it. 
- Now w/after life, but about time on earth.
- All about stoic tests (see Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy))
- What up sets people is not the setbacks in themselves, but there judgements of them. 

# Fumble Rules (guide to grammar and usage)
- Overly clever, not enough actionable informaiton.
- Some of it: kill "with regaurd to", "with reference to", "on account of", "by means of", "as regaurds", "with the exception of"

# David Foster Wallace Bio ("Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story")
- Good 
- Serous mental problems, Big pot and alcohol problems, big into AA.
- Interested in Buddhism
- "There world is everything that is the case" (Tractatus. Walace though one of the best opening lines in western it.)
- Does our understanding of what we experience derive from objective reality or from cognitive limitations with us ? (Is language window or cage?)
- Do we have real existence outside of what we do/say/perceive? Are these really under our control? 
- Infinite Jest: 

  > Are we choosing what to love carefully enough ?

  > "Generation too afraid to say what it meant, and so in danger of fretting it had anything to say. 

  > Suddenly, for Wallace, sincerity was a virtue and saying what you meant a calling.

  > "One of the points of Infinite Jets is that the center is empty" (inside Hal theres pretty much nothing at all, he knows)

- This is water

  > The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily conscious"

  > Learning how to think really means being aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to **choose** how you construct meaning from experience

# Breath: the new science of a lost art
- Fantastic
- 90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution) 
- molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air") 
- o2 produces 16x the energy than c02
- Two ways body makes energy from air/food

  > w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout

  > w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks

- Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue. 
- Mouth breathing #1 cause of cavities
- Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity
- Internal organs are malleable
- We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.
- We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2
- CO2 si the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.
- Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2
- Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min
- Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers
- With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit. 
- When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline
- When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -> pH lower: more acidic.
- All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.
- Breathing is power switch to autonomic nervous system. 
- Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.
- Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs
- Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress
- Amygdala the alarm circut of fear
- Chemoreceptors in brainstem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain 
- Chemoreceptor flexibalitiy is part of what distinguishes good and great atheletes
- Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of resiratory gases in teh body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.
- "If I had to lmit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath beter"
- humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage. 
- Mouthbreathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep
- Mouthbreathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brane sacretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.
- If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more. 


# Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History (Patrick Hunt)
- Rosetta Stone - key to egyptian writting: hyerogliphs
- Troy - Dicipline of archeaelogy started here. Soil and whats in it also can be read like books. Established truth behind homeric poems.
- Nineveh Library - Collection of 20k tablets form 1st military empire: Assyrians. Known for cruelty. Capital city burned. 
- Machu Picchu - Spectacular natual beauty. Hidden city of Incas Peru. 
- King tuts tomb - Superstar in modern world, barely relevant to ancient Egypt. Riches in minor tomb staggering even to modern standards. 
- Pompee - Eyewitness record of eruption. City well-preserved, mid existence. Tells us much about ancient Roman life. ("More Important than Rome")
- Dead Sea Scrolls - Oldest biblical documents. Odd history of being kipt from public.
- Thera - Possibly Atlantis. Mianoan island that sufferent volcanic eruption.
- Olduvai goerge - The key to human evolution. Most distant human relitives
- Tomb of 10k warriors - Key to understanding how China unified. 

# Extreme Ownership (Jocko Wilnick) 
- Very good
- Overly wordy, but many good points
- Extreme Ownership: 

  > requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans

  > requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure

 - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
 - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance
 - Ego clouds/discrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own) 
 - *Cover and Move*: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"
 - "Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)
 - For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process
 - *Commanders Intent* most important part of brief
 - Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in
