# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.
