# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.


# The Design of everyday things
  - Overall entertaining, didn't take much away.
  - Duty of machines and people who design them to understand people. Not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines
  - Accident at 3-mile island: problem was plants control systems
  - People themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they encounter. 
  - Most human behavior is the result of subconscious processes => Many of our beliefs about how people behave -- including ourselves -- are wrong. 
  - Tend to believe that thought can be separated from emotion. Wrong. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotion, emotions  drive thoughts. 
  - Cognition tries to make sense of the world, emotion assigns value. 
  - We often dont know what we are about to do, say, or think until after we have dont it. (Good reason to journal) 
  - We tend to use logic and reason after the fact to justify our decisions to ourselves and others. (What does this say about "interpretable AI"?) 
  - "Human error" usually the result of poor design. Should be called "System Error" 
  - Dont criticize unless you can do better.
  - B/c so much knowledge is in the environment, surprising how little we need to learn. People can do well and still be unable to describe what they do. 
  - Profoundly erroneous truism, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them" - whitehead
  - Metric system was developed by the French in the 1790s, yet 3 countries still resist its use: USA, Liberia, and Myanmar. 
  - Early plastics were designed to look like wood. 
  - A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all. 
  - Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them.  They start by trying to understand what the real issues are. 
  - Most companies compare features with companies to strengthen weaknesses. Better strategy to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more, Then focus marketing on strengths. 
  - Reading far faster than listening in terms of acquiring info. 
  - Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out which parts DIDN'T fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 


# The Button (William Perrry and Tom ?) 
   - Very good / Learned a lot/ lot of overlap with previous Perry book / Bit repetitive
   - Under current US policy presidents have authority to launch nukes 1st and is not limited to retaliation! (Can be launched with in mins) 
   - Once launched cannot be recalled. 
   - The threat of Russia launching attack on US is vanishingly small, smaller than the risk that we might start war by mistake => current nuclear policy is very dangerous. (ESP given that it is susceptible to cyber attack)) 
   - Short of mutiny, no one can stop president launching nukes for whatever reason. 
   - Only 25% of public knows president has sole authority
   - Putting this much power in the hand of one person goes against everything the constitution stands for.  Congress has sole power to declare war. Lincoln: "No one man should hold the power to take us to war"
   - Risks of having nukes ready to launch on minutes notice outweigh any perceived benefits. System is unconstitutional, dangerous, outdated and unnecessary. 
   - Original rationale of sole authority nothing to do with using them quickly. Everything to do with guarding against over-zealous generals. 
   - Fixed location of ICBMs are known, unlike subs. Only way for ICBMs to survive 1st strike form Russia is if fired on warning. (Extremely dangerous b/c we know warning system fallible) 
   - Climate science => Full scale nuclear attach suicidal even if no retaliation.
   - Risk of surprise attack  << Risk of stumbling into war
   - 1982 Soviets declared for 1st time that would not use nukes first (Us has never said as much...)
   - A nuclear war by mistake would be just as deadly as one by intent. 
   - Nixon ordered a tactical nuclear strike on North Korea after they downed a spy plane. Kissinger intervened and settled the situation down until NIXON WAS SOBER. 
   - Stuxnet: First attack of a major nature which was used  to cause serious physical damage. 
   - Cyber threats, which did not exist when the systems were built, dramatically increase the danger of accidental nuclear war. 
   - If we cannot be confident that systems will work under attack (eg: if systems taken offline by cyber attack)  what does this say about the viability of nuclear deterrence ?
   - If no sane president would even order the 1st use of the bomb, then why does US policy allow 1st use ? It should not.   
   - US plans to spend 2 trillion over next 30 years on nukes. 
   - ICBMs Russia knows where they are, and would knock them out 1st. Bombers and subs protect and act as a deterrence, not ICBMs. 
   - US doesn't not need ICBMs and should phase them out without replacement. Would save $ 150B  would take "missile states" out of cross-hairs and would remove and accidental threat. 
   - The triad (ICBMs/subs/ bombers) emerged mainly from inter-service rivalry. 
   - Nukes are the only immediate existential threat to the US. 
   - Combined Test Ban. still in limbo. US not test nuke since 92. but the treaty does not come into force until the US ratifies. US led the world to negotiate the treaty, but cannot get organized enough to sign it. 


# The scientific revolution : Aspirations and Achievements
  - Acording to Aristotle, it is a matter of observation that the heavens never change. They must therefore be composed of an oncorruptible 5th element: ether.
  - An argument agianst Aristarchus' helocentric model was that the stars were always observed to be in the same position relative to the earth at all times of day and year => earth doesnt move. Aristarchus countered that the stars are infinitely far away. 
  - The stoics were rigidly deterministic. 
  - Three developments that encouraged the skeptics: The reformation / the discovery of the new world / recent publication of ancient texts of skeptics
  - Astronomers observed a bright new star in 1572 and a new coment 5 years later. In both cases, careful observation made it clear that these phenomena were super lunary. 
  - Mersenne posulated (for 1st time) that the workd can usefully be concieved of as a machine whose working is to be explained mathematically. 
  - Descartes 1st to arrive at the principle of inertia. 
  - Descartes had a (deeply flawed) model of the behavoour of stars and planets that was truly mechanical. 
  - In the second half of the 17C England was transformed from a hereditary monarchy into a constitutional government in which King was limited by Parliament. 
  - Boyle described experiments that failed. 

# Sapiens 
  - Outstanding!
  - Timeline: 3e9 ya Beginning of Biology / 7e4 Cognitive revolution (Beginning of History)  / 1e4 Agricultural revolution / 5e3 1st kingdoms / 5e2 scientific revolution (entire planet single historical event) / 2e2 industrial revolution
  - Present: organisms increasingly shaped by intelligent design rather than natural selection
  - Scientific revolution may well end history and start something different (Reason that now is different) 
  - Most important thing about prehistory humans: They were insignificant animals with no more impact on the environment than other animals.
  - Chimps closest ancestor: split 6e6 ya
  - Human Brain: ~3% of body weight / but 25% energy use (Only ~8% energy use in other apes) 
  - Women who gave birth earlier when the infants head was smaller fared better / lived to have more children (humans are born prematurely) 
    This contributed greatly both to humans extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems. Raising children required constant help from family members and neighbors. 
    Since born underdeveloped, humans can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than other animals
  - Humans position in the food chain (until quite recently) was solidly in the middle
  - In the last 1e5 years, we have leaped to the top of the food chain. This has had enormous consequences. Changed so fast that the ecosystem could not adjust.  
    We are full of fears and anxieties over our new position. 
  - Cooking inadvertently opened the way to big brains in humans. (Hard to have both big brain and long intestines)
  - Cognitive revolution: new ways of thinking and communicating. 3-7e5 ya
  - Can never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. 
  - Sapiens can cooperate in extraordinarily flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. This is why sapiens rule the world.
  - How did humans eventually found cities with 1e5 people and empires with 1e8 people ? Probably from fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate by believing in common myths. 
  - There are no gods, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside of the common imagination of human beings. 
  - Corporations among humans most ingenious inventions. Legally independent of people who set them up. Became the main players in the economy. Often forget they exist only in our imaginations. 
  - Since the cognitive revolution humans have been living in a dual reality. 
       Objective: rivers/ trees / lions    Imagined: gods/nations and corporations
  - Since the cognitive revolution we have been able to revise behavior rapidly in accordance with changing needs (fast forward evolution) 
     eg: Catholic Church survived for centuries not by passing on genes, but stories. 
  - Cognitive revolution: History separates from biology. Narrative is now primary means of explaining the development of humans (Not biological theories) 
  - Real differences between us and chimps is the mythical glue that binds us. 
  - Our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. 
  - Foragers where less likely to suffer starvation and were more healthy than their peasant descendants.
  - The stories that foragers told themselves is one of the biggest holes in understanding human history. 
  - Among all the worlds large creatures, the only survivors will be humans and the farmland creatures that are our slaves.
  - Agricultural revolution 1e5 ya
  - >90% of the calories we eat come from a handful of plants and animals our ancestors domesticated between 9k BCE - 3k BCE. 
     (There has been no noteworthy plant or animal domesticated in 2e3 years) 
  - Scholars once claimed agricultural revolution as a great leap forward for humanity. Fantasy! No evidence people became more intelligent. AR => harder lives for those who lived through it.
  - Plants domesticated humans, not the other way around.
  - The AR made the future far more important than it had even been before.
  - If we dont believe in God, creation and souls, how/why are people equal? 
  - "Biological Declaration of Independence": We hold these truths ... self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure"
  - An imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them
  - Slave trade: Paradoxically genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority; precisely because the Africans were fitter in tropical climates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European masters.
  - Biology enables, culture forbids
  - Even among chimps the alpha male wins his position by building a stable coalition with other males and females, not through mindless violence.
  - How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women) ? At present we have no good answer.
  - Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.
    The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.
  - Consistency is the playground of dull minds.
  - Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset.
  - The 1st millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal order, whose devotees could for the first time imagine the entire world and the entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws: Monetary order / Imperial order / order of universal religions.
  - Money is a psychological construct.  Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.
  - Whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that *other people believe in something*
  - Money is the apogee of human tolerance. Money more open minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits.
  - Contemporary critique of empires: they do not work / they are evil. First statement is non-sense, the second is deeply problematic. To color all empires black and to disavow all imperial legacies is to reject most of human culture.
  - Empire has been the worlds most common form of political government for the last 2500 years
  - Monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the universe -- and He's evil.
  - The central figure in Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Guatama.
  - No matter what people achieve they are never content.  Suffering is caused by behavior patterns in ones own mind. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering.  Meditation trains the mind to focus all its attention on the question "What am I experiencing now?"  rather than on "What would I rather be experiencing?" 
  - The first principle of monotheistic religions is "God exists. What does He want from me?" The first principle of Buddhism is "Suffering exists. How do I escape it?"
  - If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on beliefs in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.
    The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of natural-law religions such as liberalism, Communism, nationalism, and Nazism.
  - Humanism is a belief that Homo Sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally different form the nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Humanists believe that the unique nature of human beings ins the most important thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe.
  - The liberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional christian belief in free and eternal individual souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly difficult for liberals to explain  what is so special about individual Sapiens.
  - Social humanism is built on monotheist foundations. The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the monotheistic conviction that all souls are equal before God.
  - Our liberal political and judicial system are founded on the belief that every individual has a sacred inner nature, indivisible and immutable, which gives meaning to the world,  and which is the source of all ethical and political authority. Yet over the last 200 years, the life sciences have thoroughly undermined this belief. Scientist have found no soul, they argue behavior is determined by hormones, genes and synapses, rather than by free will.  Our judicial and political systems largely try to sweep such inconvenient discoveries under the rug. How long can we maintain the way separating the department of biology from the departments of law and political science.
  - One of the distinguishing marks of history - the better you know a particular historical period the *harder* it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not another.
  - Unlike physics or economics, history  is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.
  - Cultures are a kind of mental infection or parasite with humans as its unwitting host
  - Coping with the scientific revolution: Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate effectively.  If the evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together ?  All modern attempts to stabilize the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods: 1) Take a scientific theory, and in opposition to common scientific practices, declare that it is a final and absolute truth (Nazis, Communists) 2) Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientific absolute truth (liberal humanism).
  - Most ancient myth to come down to us - the Gilgamesh myth of ancient Sumer (defeat death). 
  - In 1775 Asia accounted for 80% of the world economy.
  - European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history. Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. European imperialists set out in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.
  - The first modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, who argued that the islands discovered by Columbus were not islands off the East Asian coast, but rather an entire continent unknown to Scriptures, classical geographers , and contemporary Europeans.
  - Poetic Justice: 1/4 of the world is named after a little-known Italian whose sole claim to fame is that he had the courage to say "We dont know"
  - Discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favor present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged the Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed.
  - Not one expedition of either exploration or conquest was ever sent to America from the Islamic world, India or China. The first non-European power that tried to send a military expedition to America was Japan in 1942.
  - What enables banks - and the entire economy - to survive and flourish is our trust in the future.
  - Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future.  The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or know how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn't trust the future would be better than the present.
  - Adam Smiths claim that the selfish human urge to increase profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history - revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, bet even more so from a moral and political perspective.
  - Capitalism's belief in perpetual economic growth flies in the face of almost everything we know about the universe. Banks and governments print money, but ultimately, it is the scientists who foot the bill.
  - There is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves, and charlatans. Markets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft and violence.
  - The rise in European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this calamity. The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely economic enterprise, organized and financed by the free market according to the laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading companies sold shares on major stock exchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking for a good investment bought these shares.   
  - When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe.
  - The Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. Before the Industrial Revolution, since human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device available, muscle power was the key to all human activities. Every few decades or so we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of energy available to us keeps growing.
  - Chemists discovered Aluminum only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from its ore was extremely difficult and costly. For decades Al more expensive than gold. In 1860s, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned aluminum cutlery for his finest guests, less important visitors had to make due with gold
  - The IR was above all else the second agricultural revolution: without the industrialization of agriculture the urban IR could never have taken place.
  - Ironically, the same scientific disciplines which shape our milk machines and egg machines have lately demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that mammals and birds have a complex sensory and emotional make-up. They not only feel physical pain, but can also suffer emotional distress.
  - The basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and reproduction.
  - Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world.
  - Capitalist-consumerist ethic: "Invest!" and "Buy!" This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do.
  - German physicists found a way to determine the weather conditions in London based on tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast rings of big Ben.
  - The most momentous social revolution that ever befell humankind is the collapse of the family and the local community and their replacement by the state and the market. Millions of years of evolution have designed us to live and think as community members. Within a mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals. Nothing testifies better to the awesome power of culture.
  - These days every year is revolutionary. Today, even a thirty-year old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers "When I was young, the was completely different".
  - During the last 70 years, humankind has for the first time faced the possibility of complete self-annihilation and has experienced a fair number of actual wars and genocides. Yet these decades were also the most peaceful era in human history- by a wide margin. This is surprising because these very same decades experienced more economic, social and political change than any previous era. The tectonic plates of history are moving at a frantic pace, but the volcanoes are mostly silent.
  - Wealth today consists mainly of human capital and organizational know-how. It is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military force. The few full-scale international wars that still take place in the world, eg Middle east, occur in places were wealth is old-fashioned material wealth.
  - Ours is the first time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite - politicians, business people, intellectuals and artists which genuinely see war as both evil and avoidable.
  - Did the wealth humankind accumulated in the last 5 centuries translate into a new-found contentment? If not, what is the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry ? Historians seldom ask these questions, yet they are the more important questions one can ask of history.
  - The brief golden age of the last half-century may turn out to have sown the seeds of future catastrophe.
  - We can congratulate ourselves with on the unprecedented accomplishments of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals.
  - Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being and between bad marriages and misery.
  - The most important finding regarding happiness is that it doesn't not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or community. Rather it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.  Being satisfied with what you already have is far more important that getting more of what you want.
  - People are made happy by one thing and one thing only -- pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the lottery or found new love jumps from joy is not really reaction to the money or the lover. She is reaction to various hormones coursing throughout her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signal flashing between different parts of their brain.
  - Happiness and miser play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction.
  - There is only one historical development that has real significance. Today, when we finally realize that the keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical system, we can focus on the only that that can make us truly happy: manipulating our biochemistry. Prozac, for example, does not change regimes, but by raising serotonin levels it lifts people out of their depression.
  - Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions - none of these will bring you happiness.  Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine oxytocin.
  - If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry.
  - To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations.
  - A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.
  - Although the people in all cultures and eras have felt the same types of pleasures and pains, the meaning they ascribed to their experiences has probably varied widely. If so, the history of happiness might have been far more turbulent than biologists imagine. Its a conclusion that does not necessarily favor modernity.
  - As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. *Any* meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion.  Counter point: the beginning of infinity, science, humanity. 
  - Buddhism has assigned the question of happiness more importance than perhaps any other human creed. For 2500 years, Buddhists have systematically studied the essence and causes of happiness. Buddhism shares the basic insight of the biological approach, namely that happiness results from processing occurring within one's body, and not form events in the outside world.
  - If I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather the real root of suffering is th e never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit the mind in never satisfied. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied.
  - This idea is so alien to modern liberal culture that when Western New Age movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them into liberal terms. "Happiness begins within" This is exactly what biologists argue, but more or less the opposite of what Buddha said. Buddha agreed with biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions.  Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Buddha's recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings. 
  - If Buddhism is right, our entire understanding of the history of happiness might be misguided. Maybe it isn't so important whether peoples expectations are fulfilled and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings. The main question is whether people know the truth about themselves.
  - Most history books say nothing about how the course of history has influenced the happiness and suffering of individuals. This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history.
  - History is the next stage in the continuum of physics to chemistry to biology.
  - Homo sapiens are transcending biologically determined limits. It is now beginning to break the laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design. The first crack in the old regime appeared 10k years ago in the Agriculture revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-moving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of the offspring would be both fat and slow. It was a race of chickens unknown to nature, produced by intelligent design not of a god but of a human.
  - Today the 4 billion year old regime of natural selection is facing a completely different challenge: scientists are directly engineering living beings.
  - The Scientific Revolution may prove itself far greater than a mere historical revolution. It may turn out to be the most important biological revolution since the appearance of life on earth. If this happens, the whole of human history up to that point might, with hindsight, be reinterpreted as a process of experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionized the game of life. Such a process should be understood from a cosmic perspective of billions of years, rather than from a human perspective of millennia. 
  - Biologists are right about the past, but  the proponents of intelligent design might, ironically, be right about the future.
  - The Cognitive Revolution that turned Homo sapiens from an insignificant ape into the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in the physiology or even the size of and external shape of the Sapiens brain. It apparently involved no more than a few small changes to internal brain structure. Perhaps another small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive Revolution, create a completely new type of consciousness, and transform Homo Sapiens into something altogether different.
  - The last days are fast approaching. Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds. (It may take a few millennia, but from the the perspective of 70k years of Sapiens history, what are a few millennia?)
  - What do we want to become? This question dwarfs the debates that currently preoccupy politicians, philosophers, scholars and ordinary people. After all, today's debates between today's religions, ideologies, nations and classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo Sapiens. And yet the great debates of history are important because at least the first generation of the new gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human designers.
  - the implication of creating a mind in a computer are far more dramatic than curing psychiatric illness. This is why the Gilgamesh project is the flagship of science. It serves to justify everything science does.
  - "What do we want to want? " Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven't given it enough thought.
  - Modern Humans: Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We a consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction. Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who dont know what they want ?
  - Humans are gods to other animals (not benevolent ones!)



# Caffeine (Audio Book)
  - Short but sweet
  - Caffeine is the only drug we regularly give our children (in pop)
  - By far the most widely used psychoactive drug.
  - Plants use caffeine to drug bees into pollinating their flowers even if the plants are out of nectar. (Good for plant, bad for bee)
  - Question arises about humans. Coffee plants have clearly benefited. Not clear if net positive for humans.
  - Improved society in 17C for sure:
    - It was boiled, made safe for drinking.
    - Has some anti microbial features
    - Improves focus/concentration
    - Substitute for booze
    - Laxative (Constipation was a big problem in the 17C)
  - Probably very detrimental to our sleep
    - half-life of 6 hours in our system (1/4 life 12hrs)
    - Addictive: Coffee is the cure for the problem it causes
  - Arabs  had monopoly on coffee plant (were making a killing)
    - Dutchman smuggled it out to Java (This was the seed for most of coffee in the new world)
  - Charles II tried to ban coffee houses in England, was afraid that it would foment revolution. People ignored him. 


# How to decide (By Annie Duke)
  - Average overall. Learned something, but much of it was at too low of a level.
  - Only two things determine how your life turns out; luck and the quality of your decisions (You only have control over one of these)
  - Unlikely to have a class on decision making until college or beyond.
  - We dont even have a common language for talking about decision making.
  - Using your "gut" to decide: Cant know whether you've "used" it properly, all you can see is the output.
  - Where not good at recognizing when sacrificing quality in decision making isn't a big deal.
     - "Knowing when the hammer is good enough is a meta skill worth developing"
     - "Knowing when its okay to save time is part of a good decision process"
  - The quality of the outcome casts a shadow over our ability to see the quality of the decision.
  - Making it a habit of asking yourself "If I where wrong, why would that be?"
      helps to approach your own beliefs with more skepticism (Reduce systematic uncertainty)
  - The happiness test: Will the outcome of your decision have any effect on happiness in a year? a month ? a year?
    If no, then you can speed up the decision with little cost.
  - "Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant.
      (Mental model for spotting opportunities)
  - When a decision is hard that means its easy. The closeness of the options is what slowing you down. Actually this is a signal that you can go fast)
  - The lower the cost to quit, the faster you can go. Easier to unwind and choose something else. (Should think more in advance about option to quit)
  - Decision stacking: Can you make lower impact, easier to quit decisions that will teach you something before the high-impact one-way decision (Rent before buy)
  - "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that" - John Stuart Mill


# Project Management for Dummies
  - Not very useful
  - Lot of obvious suggestions (mostly already doing)
  - Leader vs Manager
  - WBS - "Work breakdown structure" list of all thinkgs that need doing
  - Critical Path: Dont assign yourself (Project manager) to items on the critical path.
  - Dont assign other people to work on a task that you cant clearly describe.
  - Assign yourself the talkst that you do best. "Law of comparative advantage"
  - Posessing a trait is not enough, you must help others see that you posess it.
  - Honesty: telling what you believe to be the truth
  - Integrity: having agreement between what you say and do

# Electronics (A systems approach)
  - Generally very good. Gets to advanced topics quickly.
  - Some redundancy / unnecessary details / out of date
  - Want signal to have low output resistance, load to have high input resistance
  - Large variations in gain from active circuits (OpAmps) can be overcome by negative feedback.
  - MOSFETs require very small area of Si. Resistors use large area should be avoided where possible on (ICs)
  - Power in CMOS determined by small current that flows when switching.
  - Shift registers used to convert parallel words into stream of bits on single line "Serial data". Can be used "backwards" to generate parallel data from serial input.
  - Although very large numbers of devises could be combined with in single chip, difficult to identify circuits that could be used in large numbers to justify development cost. Intel found a solution in 1971 with the programable microprocessor.


# SCRUM (Jeff Sutherland)
  - Good book overall. Could have been a lot shorter. too many examples / too much bragging / I think the idea. Would be interesting to try to implement
  - Only problem with Gantt charts: they are always wrong.
  - Gantt charts used to plan WWI (developed just prior)
  - Main idea: Whenever you start a project why not regularly check in to see if heading in the right direction/is actually what people want.
  - 80% of the value of any piece of software in 20% of the features.
  - People > process / Produts that work > documenting specs / Collaborating > negotiating / responding to change > following a plan
  - Three daily questions: What did you do since last meeting ? What are you going to do next ? What is getting in your way ?
  - That very large groups do LESS seems to be an iron clad rule of human nature.
  - Chaging TEAM performance mucn more important (by orders of magnitude) than changing individual performance.
  - Dont look for bad people, look for bad systems - one that incentivize bad behaviours and reward poor performance
  - Time makes up your life, wasting it is a form of suicide.
  - A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it should.
  - Normal Project Management Planning is stupid because people are so bad at predicting how much work something requires.
  - Key to refine they plan THROUGHOUT they project, rather than do it all up front.
  - What is the little improvement that can be done right away that will make things better?
  - He who will defend everything, defends nothing.


# Map and Territory (Yudakoskwi)
  - Very good
  - Series of lesswrong blog posts written up.
  - Rationality is about fixing the systematic errors human brains tend to make, or finding workarounds
  - Our ability to control our muscles is evolutionary ancient, our ability to reason about our own reasoning processes is much more recent innovation
  - The inner-eye isnt sightless, though it sees blurrily with systematic distortion.
  - That which can be destroyed by the truth should be, that which the truth nourishes should thrive.
  - Science: reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the content of your mind mirror the content of the world.
  - Science: an understandable process that correlates human brains with reality.
  - Human Brain: flawed lens that can understand its own flaws and apply high-order corrections. This (when practiced) make the lens far more powerful.
  - To anticipate sensory experiences as pricicely as possible we must posess beliefs that are not anticipations of snsory experience.
  - Modern concept of religion as purely ethical derives from every other areas having been taken over by better institutions. Ethics is whats left.
     Or rather, people think that ethics is left.
  - If you say the earth is flat, people will look at you like your crazy. yet if you say the Bible is your source of ethics, women will not slap you!
  - "Of course it matters who started the fight !"
  - "Applause light" Saying something that is so trite that the reversal sounds abnormal, then the unreversed statement is not conveying new information.
  - A belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to belive otherwise.
  - The strength of a model is not what it can explain, but what it cant.
  - Mystery is a property of the questions, not the answers. (Ignorance exists in the map, not the territory)  
  - Better to say "Magic" than complexity or emergence, the latter create an illusion of understand. Wiser to say magic and create plaholder (TO DO)
  - If you are equally good at explaining all outcomes, you have 0 knowledge
  - Counter-intuitive: Given incomplete information, the optimal strategy of guessing the color of cards does not resemble a typical sequence.
    "A random key does not open a random lock, just because they are both random"
  - Do not attempt ling chains of reasoning or complicated plans - just simply too difficult (See SCRUM)
  - You need one whole hell of a lot of rationality before it does anythign but lead you into new and interesting mistakes.
  - One is taught that the password to the lightbulb is "electricity!"


# Influence (Robert Caldini)
  - Very good. Reads well, learned a lot
  - Six basic tactics to get compliance. Each governed by fundamental psychological principle that directs human behavior:
    Consistency / Reciprocation / Social Proof / Authority / Liking / Scarcity
  - Well known principle of human behavior: when we ask someone to do us a favor will be more successful if we provide a reason.
  - As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow more intricate and variable we will have to depend increasingly on shortcuts to handle them all.
  - Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.
  - Odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance most of us know very little about our own automatic behavior patterns
  - Contrast Principle: If second item fairly different from 1st, we will tend to see it more differently than it actually is.
  - We are human b/c our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in a honored network of obligation
  - Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule => they made sure thier members are trined to comply and believe in it.
  - Desire to be and look consistent is a highly potent weopn of social influence often causing us to act in ways contray to our best interest.
  - Social Proof: thinking short cut, find out what others think is correct (Also vulnerable to attack)
  - When we are unsure of ourselves, when there is uncertianty, we are most likely to look and to accept the actions of others as correct.
  - Fake applause at opera: "Claque" / "Chef de claque"
  - How to defend against authority : "Is this authority truly an expert ? " / "How trustful can we expect the expert to be here?"
  - With all six of these principles we are usually and efficiently correct.
  - They fact that news conveying the fact that a product is going to be scarce is itself (the news) scarse makes it esp. persuasive.
  - Knowing these weapons of persuasion is often not enough. Knowing is a congnitive thing, cognitive proecesses are supress by our emotional reactions to the different weapons.


# Freakonomics
   - Excellent. Exactly up my alley.
   - Morality represents the way that people would like the world to work, whereas economics represents how the world really does work.
   - Incentives are the cornerstone to modern life. Understanding them is the key to understanding just about any riddle.
   - The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Conventional wisdom often shoddily formed and devilishly difficult to see through
   - Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle causes.
   - "Experts" use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However they can be beat at their own game.
   - Knowing what to measure and how to measure it, makes a complicate world much less so.
   - Any incentive is inherently a trade off. The trick is to balance the extremes.
   - So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and effects in this world that a 2 penny duty on tea unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it, changes the conditions of all its inhabitants,
   - April 15th 1987, at midnight 7 million American children suddenly disappeared. Cause: The IRS changed a rule. Instead of listing the name of the dependent children, you now also had to provide a SSN (10% of all dependents vanished)
   - IF economics is a science primarily concerned with incentives, it is also a science of statistical tool to measure how people respond to those incentives.
   - Noticing where the conventional wisdom may be false - noticing perhaps the contrails of sloppy of self-interested thinking - is a nice place to start asking questions.
   - Romanian communist party rounded up women in their workplaces to administer pregnancy tests. If a women repeatedly failed to conceive she was forced to pay a "celibacy tax"
     Of all communist leaders deposed in the years around the Soviet collapse, only the Romanian lead met a violent death. (Claim: the unwanted children grew up to be violent)
   - To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is jarring.
   - Be honest about your weaknesses


 
# Awaken the Giant within
   - Average overall. Lots of duplication / useless examples.
   - Our belief are like unquestioned commands, telling us how things are, what is possible and impossible.
   - The best strategy in almost any case is to find a role model. Someone who's already getting the results you want and then tap into their knowledge.
   - Lots of people know what to do, but few actually do what they know.
   - Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade.
   - 3 decisions that shape your destiny: What to focus on. / What things mean to you. / What to do.
   - Success truly is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment.
   - Success is the result of making small decisions.
   - A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided.
   - Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. (Cultivate the art of flexibility)
   - Become a hunter (aficionado) of excellence
   - Most important belief: In order to succeed and be happy we've got to be constantly improving the quality of our lives, constantly growing and expanding.
   - The only security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way.
   - Q: What did I learn today ? What did I enjoy today? How did I contribute/improve?
   - Its not enough to have a good mind, the main thing is to use it well - Descartes
   - 20% of any change is knowing how, 80% is knowing why.
   - Emotion is created by motion.
   - The real key to life is being able to make yourself feel good when you dont feel good, or dont want to. You can do this instantly by using your body to change state.
   - Q: What am I happy about now? What could I be happy about if I wanted to be?
   - Model the habitual questions of people you respect.
   - When angry: what can I learn from this so this never happens again?
   - Words you habitually choose affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience.
   - If you get upset, you loose control
   - All perception of truth is a detection of an analogy.
   - Emotions are like an internal compass which points to your goals.
   - Cultivate the appreciation for all emotions
   - The direction were heading in is more important that individual results.
   - Only way for long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals.
   - Any difficulty in decision making ultimately comes from being unclear in our values
   - Be more concerned about your character than your reputation. Character is what you really are, reputation is what others think you are
   - Only way to master your time is to organize your schedule each day to spend the majority of it doing things that are important.
   - Strive for balance, not perfection.



# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
   - Fantastic!  One of my favorite authors
   - In a world deluged by information, clarity is power.
   - Philosophy, religion and science all running out of time. People have debated the meaning of life for 1000s of years. We cannot continue this debate indefinitely. The looming ecological crises, the threat of WMDs, and the rise of technological revolution will not allow it.  AI and biotech are giving humanity the power to reshape and re-engineer life. Very soon somebody will have to decide how to use this power based on some implicit or explicit story about the meaning of life.
   - Humans think in stories, not facts, numbers or equations. The simpler the better.
   - In 1938 human offered 3 global stories to choose from: In 1968 just 2; in 1998 a single story, now we are down to 0 in 2018.
   - Much harder to struggle against irrelevance than exploitation.
   - People who reject the liberal story dont offer any coherent alternative.
   - Liberalism has no obvious answers to the biggest problems we face: ecological collapse and technical disruption
   - Economic growth will not save the ecosystem. Just the opposite, in fact, for economic growth is the cause of the ecological crises. And economic growth will not solve technological disruption for it is predicated on the invention of more and more disruptive tech.
   - Biochemistry: algorithms of the brain are far from perfect. They rely on heuristics, shortcuts and outdated circuits adapted from the African savanna rather than from the urban jungle.
   - Replacing all human drivers by computers is expected to reduce deaths and injuries by 90%.
   - The US army needs 30 people to operate every "unmanned" drone over Syria.
   - Since alpha_0 learned nothing from humans, many of its winning moves and strategies seems unconventional to the human eye. They are considered creative, in not downright genius.
   - alpha_0 went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours without human help.
   - If people play an exceptionally creative move in human-only chess tournaments, the judges will often suspect that it can possible be a human move. In chess, creativity is already considered to be the hallmark of computers rather than humans!!!
   - Human kind had to develop completely new models - liberal democracy, communist dictatorship, and fascist regimes - and it took more than a century of terrible wars and revolutions to experiment with these models, separate the wheat from the chaff, and implement the best solutions. Child labor in Dickensian coal mines, the First World War, the Great Ukrainian Famine, constituted just a small part of the tuition fees that humankind had to pay for the Industrial Revolution.
   - This time around, the failed models that might result in nuclear wars, genetically engineered monstrosities, and a complete breakdown of the biosphere. We have to do better than we did in confronting the Industrial Revolution.
   - Referendums and elections are always about human feelings not about human rationality. If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, where would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights - or perhaps any voting rights at all.
   - Once somebody gains the technological ability to hack and manipulate the human heart, democratic politics will mutate into an emotional puppet show.
   - Feelings are biochemical mechanisms that all mammals and birds use in order to quickly calculate probabilities of survival and reproduction. Feels are therefore not the opposite of rationality, they embody evolutionary rationality.
   - We dont feel the millions of neurons in the brain computing probabilities of survival and reproduction, so we erroneously believe that our feelings are the result of some mysterious "free will".
   - For all practical purposes, it was reasonable to argue that I have free will, which nobody outside of me could see. I could enjoy the illusion that I controlled my secret inner arena, while outsiders could never really understand what was happening inside me and how I make decisions.
   - We are now at the confluence of two immense revolutions. Biologists are deciphering the mysteries of the human body, and in particular of the brain and human feelings. At the same time computer scientists are giving us unprecedented data-processing power. When the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can.
   - "Trolley problems" up till now these arguments have had embarrassingly little impact on actual behavior.
   - Throughout history the limitations of actually enforcing laws provided a welcome check on the biases, mistakes and excesses of lawmakers.
   - We have bred docile cows that produce enormous amounts of milk but are otherwise far inferior to their wild ancestors. They are less agile, less curious, less resourceful. We are now creating tame humans that produce enormous amounts of data and function as very efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism, but these data-cows hardly maximize the human potential.
   - Improvements in biotechnology might make it possible to translate economic inequality into biological inequality.
   - At present, people are happy to give away their most valuable asset - their personal data - in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. Its a bit like African and Native American tribes who unwittingly old entire countries to European imperialists in exchange for colorful beads and cheap trinkets.
   - How do you regulate the ownership of data ? This may well be the most important political question of our era.
   - Pundits often blame feelings of alienation on the decline of religious and national bonds, but losing touch with your body is probably much more important. Humans have lived for millions of years with out churches and without nation states.
   - We know of no upper limit to the size of a group  with which people can identify. Most present day nations include more people than the entire world population 10k years ago.
   - Nationalism has two parts to it, one easy, the other very difficult. The easy part is to prefer people like-us over foreigners. The hard part of nationalism is to sometimes prefer strangers over friends and relatives. Tax evasion and nepotism come naturally to us, but nationalism says they are a "corruption". The ability to feel loyal to this nebulous mass is a miracle of modern history. 
   - Democracy cannot really function without nationalism.
   - Total annihilation has a way of sharpening peoples minds, and thanks in no small measure to this existential threat, a global community gradually developed over and above the various nations, because only such a community could restrain the nuclear demon.   
   - Humankind today faces three common challenges that make a mockery of all national borders, and that can only be solved through global cooperation: the nuclear challenge, the ecological challenge, and the technological challenge.
   - The nuclear challenge: In 2016, fewer people died from human violence than from obesity, car accidents or suicide. This may well have been the greatest political and moral achievement of our times.
   - The ecological challenge: Humans have been around for 100s of thousands of years and have survived numerous ice ages and warm spells. However agriculture, culture, cities, and complex societies have existed for no more than 10k years. During this period, earths climate has been relatively stable. Any deviation from the current standard will present human societies with enormous challenges than have never encountered before. Since there is no national answer to the problem of global warming, some nationalist politicians prefer to believe that the problem does not exist.
   - The technological challenge:  There again is no national answer. After 4 billion years of organic life evolving by natural selection, science is ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. We still share most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties with Neanderthals and chimpanzees. 
   - We now have a global ecology, a global economy, and a global science - but we are still stuck with only national politics. This mismatch prevents our political system from effectively countering our main problems.
   - There is no contradiction between globalism and patriotism. Patriotism isn't about hating foreigners. Patriotism is about taking care of your compatriots. And in the 21st century, in order to take good care of your compatriots you must cooperate with foreigners. So good nationalist should be good globalists.
   - Questions for political leaders: What actions will you take to ... lessen the risks of nuclear war? ... lessen the risks of climate change? .. regulate disruptive technologies such as AI and bio-engineering ? How do you see the world of 2040 ? What is your worst-case scenario, and what is your vision for the best-case scenario.
   - The victory of science over religion has been so complete that our very idea of religion has changed. We no longer associate religion with farming or medicine. This is also why the entire world has increasingly become a single civilization. When things really work, everybody adopts them. When you compare the economic policies of the Shiite Iran, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Hindu India, and Christian America, you just dont see that much of a difference. 
   - Marx argued, "religion is just a veneer". But people often identify with the decor, and peoples identities are a crucial historical force. Human power depends on mass cooperation, and mass cooperation depends on manufacturing mass identities - and all mass identities are based on fictional stories, not on scientific facts or even economic realities.
   - The Kamikaze relied on combating state-of-the-art technology with state-of-the-art religious indoctrination.
   - We are trapped between a rock and a hard place, Humankind now constitutes a single civilization, and problems such as nuclear war, ecological collapse, and technological disruption can only be solved on a global level. On the other hand, nationalism and religion still divide our human civilization into different and often hostile camps.
   - Immigration: Some cultures might be better than others.
   - Re Terrorism: a small coin in an empty jar makes a lot of noise. The very success of modern states in preventing political violence makes them particularly vulnerable to terrorism.
   - Human stupidity is one of the most important forces is history.  One potential remedy for human stupidity is a does of humility.
   - Monotheism was arguably one of the worst ideas in human history; from an ethical perspective, the birth of bigotry. Did not improve the moral standard of humans, but did make many people far more intolerant than before.
   - Does God exist ? That depends on which god you have in mind: the cosmic mystery or the worldly lawgiver?
   - After giving the name "God" to the unknown secrets of the cosmos, they then use this to somehow condemn bikinis and divorce.
   - To the best of our knowledge all of the sacred texts were written by imaginative Homo Sapiens. They are just stories invented by our ancestors in order to legitimize social norms and political structures.
   - I personally never cease to wonder about the mystery of existence. But I have never understood what it has to do with the niggling laws of Judaism, Christianity, or Hinduism. These laws were certainly very helpful in establishing and maintaining the social order for thousands of years. But in that, they are not fundamentally different from the laws of secular states and institutions.
   - Morality doesn't mean "following divine commands". It means reducing suffering. If you really understand how an action causes unnecessary suffering to yourself or others you will naturally abstain from it.
   - Every violent act in the world begins with a violent desire in somebody's mind, which disturbs that persons peace and happiness before it disturbs the peace and happiness of anybody else. If you were completely free of anger you would feel far better than if you murdered and obnoxious enemy. For some people a strong belief in a compassionate god that commands us to turn the other cheek may help in curbing anger. That's been and enormous contribution of religious belief to the peace and harmony of the world.
   - While human rights movements have developed a very impressive arsenal of arguments and defenses against religious biases and human tyrants, the arsenal hardly protects us against consumerist excesses and technological utopias.
   - Secular science has at least one big advantage over most traditional religions -- namely that it is not afraid of its own shadow.
   - Not only rationality, but individuality too is a myth. Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather we think in groups.
   - Great power inevitably distorts the truth. Power is all about changing reality rather than seeing it for what it is.
   - The problem is that it has become extremely complicated to grasp what we are actually doing. Most of the injustices in the contemporary world results from large-scale structural biases rather than from individual prejudices, and our hunter-gather brains did not evolve to detect structural biases. In trying to comprehend and judge the moral dilemmas of this scale people often resort to one of four methods: Downsize the issue / Focus on a touching human story that ostensibly stands for the whole conflict / weave conspiracy theories (These three methods try to deny the true complexity of the world) / The 4th and ultimate method is to create dogma, put our trust is some allegedly all-knowing theory, institution, or chief, and follow it wherever it leads us.
   - Even if you start with a rejection of all religious dogma and with a firm commitment to scientific truth, sooner or later the complexity of reality becomes so vexing that you might be driven to fashion a doctrine that shouldn't be questioned.
   - When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that's fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that's a religion. For better or worse, fiction is one of the most effective tools in humanities tool kit.
   - The Roman Senate claimed to have the power to turn people into gods.
   - If you want to gauge group loyalty, requiring people to believe and absurdity is a far better test than asking them to believe the truth.
   - Truth and power can travel together only so far. IF you want power, at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power. You will have to admit things -- for example, about the sources of your own power -- that will anger allies, dishearten followers, or undermine social harmony.
   - As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it.
   - One of the great fictions of all is to deny the complexity of the world and think in absolute terms: pristine purity versus satanic evil
   - We cannot investigate everything ourselves. But precisely because of that, we need to at least carefully investigate our favorite sources of information. If you want reliable information, pay good money for it. If you get your news for free, you might well be the product.
   - In the 21st century, science fiction might be the most important genre of all.
   - In truth, everything you will ever experience in life is within your own body and your own mind.
   - Huxley's genius consists in showing that you can control people far more securely through love and pleasure than through fear and violence.
   - Our old stories are crumbling, and no new story has so far emerged to replace them.
   - The last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information. They already have far too much of it. Instead, people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and above all to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world.
   - For thousands of years philosophers and prophets have urged people to know themselves. This advice was never more urgent than in the 21st century, now we have serious competition. We are living in the era of hacking humans.
   - To give meaning to my life a story needs to satisfy just two conditions: First, it must give me some role to play. Second, it must extend beyond my horizons.
   - "This is the body!" in Latin "Hoc est corpus!" got garbled into "Hocus pocus!"
   - If by "free will" you mean the freedom to do what you desire, then yes, humans have free will. But if by "free will" you mean the freedom to choose what to desire, then no, humans have no free will.
   - As long as you strongly identify with whatever thoughts and desires pop up in your mind, you dont need to make much effort to know yourself. You think you already know exactly who you are. But once you realize "Hey these thoughts aren't me. They are just biochemical vibrations!" then you also realize you have no idea who -- or what -- you are.
   - The Buddha taught that the three basic realities of the universe are that everything is constantly changing, nothing has any enduring essence, and nothing is completely satisfying. Suffering emerges because people fail to appreciate this.
   - According to the Buddha, then, life has no meaning, and people dont need to create any meaning. They just need to realize that there is no meaning, and therefore be liberated from the suffering caused by our attachments and our identification with empty phenomena.
   - The big question facing humans isn't "What is the meaning of life?" but rather "how do we stop suffering?"
   - The academic world provided me with powerful tools with which to deconstruct all the myths humans ever created, but it did not offer satisfying answers to the big questions of life. On the contrary, it encouraged me to focus on narrower and narrower questions.
   - What is there that endures from birth to death ? The more closely you observe yourself, the more obvious it becomes that nothing endures even from one moment to the next.
   - Suffering is not an objective condition in the outside world. It is a mental reaction generated by my own mind.
   - Meditation is any direct observation of ones own mind.



# A world without email (Cal Newport)
   - Fantastic!  (Changed my life for the better)
   - A widely accepted premise of the modern knowledge work is that email saved us.
   - What if email didn't save us, but instead accidentally traded minor convinces for a major drag on real productivity, leading to slower economic growth over the last few decades?
   - Deep work argues that the knowledge sector is undervaluing concentration. While the ability to rapidly communicate using digital messages is useful, the frequent disruptions also make it hard to focus, which has a major impact on our ability to produce value output.
   - Constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work. it has instead become totally intertwined with how work gets done.
   - As email spread in the 80s and 90s it introduced something novel: low-friction communication at scale.
   - We didn't just shift our existing volume of voicemails, faxes, and memos to email. We completely transformed the underlying workflow that determines how our daily efforts unfold.
   - There is a massive productivity currently latent in the knowledge sector. To unlock it will require much more systematic thinking about how best to organize.
   - The future of work is increasingly cognitive. This means that the sooner we take seriously how human brains actually function, the sooner we'll realize that the hyperactive hive mind is a disastrously ineffective way to organize our efforts.
   - Knowledge work does not yet have its Henry Ford, but workflow innovations with impact on the same scale as the assembly line are inevitable.
   - Our brains do not parallel process information.
   - "I worry that ill face my death and realize that y life got lost in this frantic flotsam of daily stuff."
   - Study of the Stirrup: example of a technology introduced for a simple reason (to make riding horses easier) leading to vast and complicated consequences never imagined by its inventors (the rise of medieval feudalism).
   - Computer scientists investigating asynchronous communications discovered that spreading out communication with unpredictable delays introduced tricky new complexities.
   - Since 1900 the productivity of manual labor increased by a factor of 50. The push to make knowledge work more efficient will be the central challenge of our times.
   - The attention capital principle: the productivity of the knowledge sector can be significantly increased if we identify workflows that better optimize the human brains ability to sustain-ably add value to information.
   - Build structures around autonomy
   - Workflows should not be left to individuals to figure out on their own, as the most effective systems are unlikely to arise naturally.
   - Minimize mid-task context switching and minimize the sense of communication overload.
   - In knowledge work, "Innovation" applies to the products we produce, but not the means by which we produce them.
   - Good is not the same as easy, fulfilling is not the same as convenient.
   - The process principle: introducing smart production processes to knowledge work can dramatically increase performance and make the work much less draining.
   - Maintain a board for every major role in your professional life.
   - You need set times each week to review and update your personal board
   - Put your solo review meetings on your calendar and protect them like any other meeting or appointment.
   - "You should spend 30x the amount of time training someone to do a task than it would take you to do the task yourself one time"
   - By adding complexity to the rules we use to structure our communication, the actual amount of information required by the interactions can be reduced (ala Shannon).
   - Central idea in Shannon's information theory: clever protocols that take into account the structure of the information being communicated can perform MUCH better than naive approaches.
   - Anyone whose job requires more than one or two scheduled events in a typical week should be using a scheduling service
   - Why are the recipients in email addresses almost always people, and not, for example, departments, projects, or activities.
   - When you eliminate support staff, the skilled professionals become less intellectually specialized, as they have to spend more time on administrative work that computers made just easy enough for them to handle on their own
   - The specialization principle: In the knowledge sector, working on fewer things, but doing teach thing with more equality and accountability, can be the foundation for significantly more productivity.
   - there are few things more valuable than someone who consistently produces valuable output, and few approaches to work more satisfying than being given the room to focus on things that really matter.
   - Technological change is not additive; it is ecological.  A new medium does not add something; it changes everything. In the year 1500, after the printing press was invented, you did not have old Europe plus the printing press. You had a different Europe.
   - Knowledge worker productivity is the moonshot of the twenty first century.
