# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.


# The Design of everyday things
  - Overall entertaining, didn't take much away.
  - Duty of machines and people who design them to understand people. Not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines
  - Accident at 3-mile island: problem was plants control systems
  - People themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they encounter. 
  - Most human behavior is the result of subconscious processes => Many of our beliefs about how people behave -- including ourselves -- are wrong. 
  - Tend to believe that thought can be separated from emotion. Wrong. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotion, emotions  drive thoughts. 
  - Cognition tries to make sense of the world, emotion assigns value. 
  - We often dont know what we are about to do, say, or think until after we have dont it. (Good reason to journal) 
  - We tend to use logic and reason after the fact to justify our decisions to ourselves and others. (What does this say about "interpretable AI"?) 
  - "Human error" usually the result of poor design. Should be called "System Error" 
  - Dont criticize unless you can do better.
  - B/c so much knowledge is in the environment, surprising how little we need to learn. People can do well and still be unable to describe what they do. 
  - Profoundly erroneous truism, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them" - whitehead
  - Metric system was developed by the French in the 1790s, yet 3 countries still resist its use: USA, Liberia, and Myanmar. 
  - Early plastics were designed to look like wood. 
  - A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all. 
  - Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them.  They start by trying to understand what the real issues are. 
  - Most companies compare features with companies to strengthen weaknesses. Better strategy to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more, Then focus marketing on strengths. 
  - Reading far faster than listening in terms of acquiring info. 
  - Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out which parts DIDN'T fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 


# The Button (William Perrry and Tom ?) 

   - Very good / Learned a lot/ lot of overlap with previous Perry book / Bit repetitive
   - Under current US policy presidents have authority to launch nukes 1st and is not limited to retaliation! (Can be launched with in mins) 
   - Once launched cannot be recalled. 
   - The threat of Russia launching attack on US is vanishingly small, smaller than the risk that we might start war by mistake => current nuclear policy is very dangerous. (ESP given that it is susceptible to cyber attack)) 
   - Short of mutiny, no one can stop president launching nukes for whatever reason. 
   - Only 25% of public knows president has sole authority
   - Putting this much power in the hand of one person goes against everything the constitution stands for.  Congress has sole power to declare war. Lincoln: "No one man should hold the power to take us to war"
   - Risks of having nukes ready to launch on minutes notice outweigh any perceived benefits. System is unconstitutional, dangerous, outdated and unnecessary. 
   - Original rationale of sole authority nothing to do with using them quickly. Everything to do with guarding against over-zealous generals. 
   - Fixed location of ICBMs are known, unlike subs. Only way for ICBMs to survive 1st strike form Russia is if fired on warning. (Extremely dangerous b/c we know warning system fallible) 
   - Climate science => Full scale nuclear attach suicidal even if no retaliation.
   - Risk of surprise attack  << Risk of stumbling into war
   - 1982 Soviets declared for 1st time that would not use nukes first (Us has never said as much...)
   - A nuclear war by mistake would be just as deadly as one by intent. 
   - Nixon ordered a tactical nuclear strike on North Korea after they downed a spy plane. Kissinger intervened and settled the situation down until NIXON WAS SOBER. 
   - Stuxnet: First attack of a major nature which was used  to cause serious physical damage. 
   - Cyber threats, which did not exist when the systems were built, dramatically increase the danger of accidental nuclear war. 
   - If we cannot be confident that systems will work under attack (eg: if systems taken offline by cyber attack)  what does this say about the viability of nuclear deterrence ?
   - If no sane president would even order the 1st use of the bomb, then why does US policy allow 1st use ? It should not.   
   - US plans to spend 2 trillion over next 30 years on nukes. 
   - ICBMs Russia knows where they are, and would knock them out 1st. Bombers and subs protect and act as a deterrence, not ICBMs. 
   - US doesn't not need ICBMs and should phase them out without replacement. Would save $ 150B  would take "missile states" out of cross-hairs and would remove and accidental threat. 
   - The triad (ICBMs/subs/ bombers) emerged mainly from inter-service rivalry. 
   - Nukes are the only immediate existential threat to the US. 
   - Combined Test Ban. still in limbo. US not test nuke since 92. but the treaty does not come into force until the US ratifies. US led the world to negotiate the treaty, but cannot get organized enough to sign it. 


# The scientific revolution : Aspirations and Achievements

  - Acording to Aristotle, it is a matter of observation that the heavens never change. They must therefore be composed of an oncorruptible 5th element: ether.
  - An argument agianst Aristarchus' helocentric model was that the stars were always observed to be in the same position relative to the earth at all times of day and year => earth doesnt move. Aristarchus countered that the stars are infinitely far away. 
  - The stoics were rigidly deterministic. 
  - Three developments that encouraged the skeptics: The reformation / the discovery of the new world / recent publication of ancient texts of skeptics
  - Astronomers observed a bright new star in 1572 and a new coment 5 years later. In both cases, careful observation made it clear that these phenomena were super lunary. 
  - Mersenne posulated (for 1st time) that the workd can usefully be concieved of as a machine whose working is to be explained mathematically. 
  - Descartes 1st to arrive at the principle of inertia. 
  - Descartes had a (deeply flawed) model of the behavoour of stars and planets that was truly mechanical. 
  - In the second half of the 17C England was transformed from a hereditary monarchy into a constitutional government in which King was limited by Parliament. 
  - Boyle described experiments that failed.
