# Bullet Journal Method
  - Very good idea
  - Like the idea of documenting my life
  - From nurse at a hospice center: The number one regret was that people wished they had stayed true to themselves
  - View BuJo as a living autobiography
  - Can track the decisions you've made, the actions that led you to where you are now. Can learn from experiences.
  - The long way is the short way.
  - True efficiency is not about speed, its about spending more time with what truly matters.
  - Our memories are unreliable.
  - The more content you try to capture during a meeting the less your thinking about whats being said. You burn through most of you attention trying to parrot the source.
  - (re: meetings) Sit for a while and give yourself a moment to process what you heard
  - When making notes: keep your future self in mind.
  - For everything you say yes to, your saying no to something else. Yes means work, sacrifice, time, and opportunity cost.
  - Organization can become a cleverly disguised form of distraction.
  - "It is not daily increase, but daily decrease. Hack away the inessential" Bruce Lee
  - (re: social media) "Exploiting vulnerability in human psychology is the bread and butter of our economy" -founding member of facebook
  - Endurance often proves to be the most cunning and lethal adversary.
  - If your goal in life is to be useful to others, start by figuring out how to be useful to yourself.
  - Add notes about social engagements: have fun ? What did you learn ? How did you feel when you where with them ? (Objective measures)


# 40 Ways to view Churchill
  - Good book, just not getting that much from it. (Bailed halfway through)
  - Interesting take on Biography: presenting both/all sides of person
  - How little we can know anyone, and how impossible is the task of summing up.
  - Churchill ignited a monetary crisis when he returned Britain to the gold standard in 1925.
  - Churchill was vehemently opposed to Indian independence.
  - "I would rather by right than consistent"

# Beyond Good and Evil
  - Wasn't doing it for me (Bailed halfway through)
  - Could tell (got the feeling) that it was interesting to the cognoscenti
  - But too much over my head.
  - "Christianity is Platonism for the people"
  - Critique of " I think therefore I am" a thought comes when it wants, not when I want it to.
  - It is not the worst things of which one is most ashamed.
  - He who attains his ideal by that very fact transcends it.
  - There are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena
  - To make someone interested in you: pretend to be embarrassed in their presence.
  - The will to overcome an emotion is ultimately the will of another emotion.
  - He who fights monsters should be careful he doesn't become one. When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss gazes into you.
  - Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, peoples it is the norm.
  - Ultimately one loves ones desires and not that which is desired.

# Mysticism and Logic (Bertrand Russel)
  - essays where hit or miss.
  - Philosophers have felt the need of both science and mysticism. Attempts to harmonize the two make philosophy (for some) greater than science or religion.
  - Plato's Cave: statement of belief in knowledge and reality truer than our senses
  - Mysticism is to be commended as an attitude toward life, not as a creed about the world.
  - Insight, untested and unsupported is an insufficient guarantee of truth.
  - Instinct is least likely to err in practical matters which aid in survival.
  - Some distrust intellect in favor of instincts adapted for survival. Response:  It is only through the intellect that we know of the struggle for survival and the evolution of man.
  - Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distortion of their own desires.
  - Scientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human pursuit. IT gives us the closest constant and most intimate relation with the outer world that is possible.
  - Our whole life if built of a number of primary instincts and impulses. Only that which is in some way connected with these (instincts and impulses) appear to us desirable or important. There is nothing (call it "reason" or "virtue") that can be outside these first movers
  - All meaning must be related to our prime desires.
  - The more fact of living is not to be desired, but the art of living in contemplation of great things.
  - The solution of the difficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is probably the greatest achievement of our age.
  - G Cantor has solved Zeno's paradoxes, turns out that its not true that if you take something away from a collection it always gets smaller. The recognition of this fact removes the difficulties and make an exact science of the infinite.
  - Pure math was discovered by Boole "Laws of thought" 1854
  - Math can be defined as the subject in which we never know what we're talking about, nor weather what we are saying is true.
  - Obviousness is always the enemy of correctness.
  - the whole of arithmetic and algebra has been shown to require 3 indefinable notions and 5 indemonstrable propositions.
  - Most numbers are infinite. Infinitely many more infinite numbers.
  - Philosophy is the science of the possible.
  - You cannot alter the past, but you can also not make the future other than it will be.
  - Obviously you can have no effect on the past. But this does not mean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes had been different. Our present wishes are conditioned by the past and therefore could not be different unless the past was different. The past cannot be different from what it was , but no more can our present wishes be different from what they are.
  - Its hard to discover any state of mind which I am aware of myself alone, as opposed to a complex of which I am a constituent.

# The Denial of Death (Earnest Becker)
  - Interesting found it too speculative in places.
  - Seemed to be speaking to very specific field in places (eg: why do I /should I care what Freud was like as a person?)
  - Places great faith (with out justification) in psychoanalysis.
  - The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles would be over. Now we are choking in truth.
  - Knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction. Insignificant fragments are magnified out of proportion, while major and historical insights lie around begging for attention.
  - The experts give us manageable thrills- if they thrill us at all.
  - Narcissism is what keeps men marching into  point blank cannon fire in wars.
  - Civilized society is a hopeful belief and protest that science and and goods "make men count" for mare than any other animal. In this sense, everything that man does is religious and heroic and yet in danger of being fictitious and fallible.
  - The crisis of modern society is that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that culture has set up
  - Children have no knowledge of death until 3-5
  - From the child of 5 to myself is but a step, but from the newborn baby to the child of 5 is an appalling distance.
  - Nothing like the essence of man has been found.
  - Mans self-consciousness makes man a small god in nature, yet at the same time man is a worm and food for worms. This duality is a painful contradiction. Lower animal spared this contradiction. (Q: Are we spared other painful contradictions from our limited knowledge/being ?
  - We are gods with anuses
  - The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body.
  - Most people tranquilize themselves in the trivial.
  - Man has an inner symbolic self which signifies certain freedom, but he is bound by a finite body which limits that freedom.
  - The self must be destroyed, brought down to nothing, in order for self-transcendence to begin. Then the self can begin to relate to powers beyond itself.
  - Man is the only organism in nature fated to puzzle out what it actually means to feel "right"
  - The most remarkable achievement in the Christian world picture: anyone can be a secure hero simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things: heaven.
  - Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to procreate.
  - as soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffing at eternal problems like life and death... he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just as society maps these problems out for them.
  - All throughout history it is the "normal, average men" who, like locusts, have laid waste to the world in order to forget themselves.
  - Salpetrice mental hospital got cleared out at the time of the French Revolution. All the neurotics found a ready-made donor of self-transcending action and heroic identity.
  - The promise of Psychology was that it would usher in the era of happiness of man, by showing him how things worked, how one things causes another. Then all man had to do was take possession of these and his happiness would be assured.
  - All the analysis in the world doesn't allow a person to find out "who he is" or why he is here on earth, why he has to die, how he should live. It is when psychology pretends to do this (when it pretends to offer itself as full explanation for human unhappiness) that it becomes a fraud.
  - Religion is "just as good a psychology" as the psychology that pretended to replace it.
  - Modern man needs a to turn to for spiritual dependence, as God is unfashionable in steps the therapist.
  - Claim: after the most exhaustive psychology quest, psychology gives way to theology
  - (DFW echos)  It is one thing to image this (theological) cure, but it is quite another thing to "prescribe" it to modern man. How hollow it must ring in his ears.
  - Freud: All cultural devices are self-hypnotic contrivances - from cars to moon rockets - ways that a surely limited animal can fascinate himself in an attempt to transcend reality.
  - The most one can achieve is a certain relaxedness an openness to experience that makes him less of a driven burden on others.
  - When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness.
  - The closing pages of this book are a realistic and regretful admission that the ego has to spread itself beyond the pleasures of the body in order for men to be men.


# Thinking about Mathematics (Stewart Shapiro)
  - Very good. Not actionable, but very interesting.
  - Come down with Structuralism
  - Classical logic and impredicative definitions are thoroughly entrenched in contemporary mathematics. Accepted not b/c sanction philosophically, but b/c smooth practice of math needs them.
  - Lowenheim-Skolem Theorems: Notions of natural number finitude, ect. cannot be captured in 1st order theories. Any 1st order theory, if it has infinite models, has unintended models that get these notions wrong.
  - Virtually all of math can be rendered in the language of set-theory, and all known theorems in math can be proved in ZFC (a version of set theory). However many interesting and important questions cannot be decided by ZFC axioms. eg: Cantors Continuum Hypothesis
  - Incompleteness theorem: Realist says it shows there is no axiomatization whose theorems are all and only the truths of arithmetic.
    "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system"
    Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability
  - The incompleteness theorem shows that the undecidable sentence phi is truth of the natural numbers => we have an informal proof of the truth of the formally undecidable sentence. There is more to arithmetic provability than can be derived in any fixed formal axiomatization. => arithmetic truth and informal arithmetic provability both out run what can be produced by a machine.
  - Kant took philosophical measure of the new scientific 19th C developments. The result was a heroic attempt to explain the necessity of math and the apriori nature of mathematical truths, while explaining the place of math in the empirical sciences.
  - Kant claimed: Structure of mathematical reasoning due to the structure of our apparatus of perception.
  - Widely agreed that Kants philosophy of math failed from later developments in math and science eg: non-euclidean Geometry.
  - Frege committed to view that all propositions about numbers are knowable. (T or F)
  - More Incompleteness: Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove.
  - Most real numbers do not have names.
  - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency (More incompleteness)
  - How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
  - Structuralism: The essence of a natural number is its relation  to other numbers. The subject matter of arithmetic is a single abstract structure. Set theorist point out that the set theoretic hierarchy contains as many isomorphissms types as possible. that is the point of the theory.

# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.
