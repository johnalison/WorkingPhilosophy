# The Road to Reality (Roger Penrose)
   - "3 mysteries of reality" (biggest take away) 
      Idea: the physical world can be described by (is contained in) the mathematical world. 
      The mathematical world can be entirely discovered (?) (understood) by the mental world.
      The  mental world (consciousness) is entirely a product of the physical world. 
      Nested loop. 
   - Interesting take on particle physics "zig-zag" model of electron interactions.
   - Interesting discussion of Cantor's theory of the infinite and Godel's incompleteness theorem.
       (Want to read the emperors new mind
   - Good take on problems with QM



# Fight Club (Cluck Palahniuk)

  - Story about awakening.
  - Character study of an person going insane
  - Looking for something to live for.
  - Paraphrasing: "Life starts when you know you are going to die."
  - "On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."
  - "This is your life and its ending one minute at a time."
  - Explicit connections: w/Buddhism some connections with Stoicism
  - Keeping personal burial money on hand (Monento Mori)

# Rise and Fall of American Growth (Robert Gordon)
  - Point that a log of growth has come from things that can only happen once: install plumbing / cure infectious diseases / ect.
  - Now in position where growth really only happening in one, small sector (IT)
  - Points out a lot of problems that will slow growth in next decades: Inequality / Education / Grov. Debt / Income Inequality

# Breakfast of Champions (Kurt Vonnegut)
 - Didn't really get it. Was obviously a lot of cleaver stuff going on, most of it was over my head. 
 - "I thank those lusts (of gold and seeing little girls underpants) for being so ridiculous for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything"
 - "Ideas on earth were badges of friendship. Friends agreed with friends to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with  enemies in order to express enmity."
 - "Seems like the only kind of job an American can get these days is committing suicide in some way"
 - I wont know myself until I find out whether life is serious or not"



# Poor Richards Almanac (Ben Franklin)
 - "No ugly lovers, no handsome prisons"
 - "Speak with contempt of non, from slave to king. The smallest bee has, (and will use) a sting"
  

# Stoic Test Challenge (William Irvine)
 - Great Book!
 - Definetly changed my life for the better. 
 - Philosophy of life: what in life is worth having and what is a strategy for obtaining it. 
 - Now w/after life, but about time on earth.
 - All about stoic tests (see Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy))
 - What up sets people is not the setbacks in themselves, but there judgements of them. 

# Fumble Rules (guide to grammar and usage)
 - Overly clever, not enough actionable informaiton.
 - Some of it: kill "with regard to", "with reference to", "on account of", "by means of", "as regards", "with the exception of"

# David Foster Wallace Bio ("Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story")
  - Good 
  - Serous mental problems, Big pot and alcohol problems, big into AA.
  - Interested in Buddhism
  - "There world is everything that is the case" (Tractatus. Wallace though one of the best opening lines in western it.)
  - Does our understanding of what we experience derive from objective reality or from cognitive limitations with us ? (Is language window or cage?)
  - Do we have real existence outside of what we do/say/perceive? Are these really under our control? 
  - Infinite Jest: 
  
    > Are we choosing what to love carefully enough ?
  
    > "Generation too afraid to say what it meant, and so in danger of fretting it had anything to say. 
  
    > Suddenly, for Wallace, sincerity was a virtue and saying what you meant a calling.
  
    > "One of the points of Infinite Jets is that the center is empty" (inside Hal there's pretty much nothing at all, he knows)
  
  - This is water
  
    > The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily conscious"
  
    > Learning how to think really means being aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to **choose** how you construct meaning from experience
  
# Breath: the new science of a lost art
 - Fantastic
 - 90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution) 
 - molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air") 
 - o2 produces 16x the energy than c02
 - Two ways body makes energy from air/food
 
   > w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout
 
   > w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks
 
 - Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue. 
 - Mouth breathing #1 cause of cavities
 - Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity
 - Internal organs are malleable
 - We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.
 - We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2
 - CO2 is the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.
 - Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2
 - Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min
 - Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers
 - With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit. 
 - When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline
 - When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -> pH lower: more acidic.
 - All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.
 - Breathing is power switch to autonomic nervous system. 
 - Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.
 - Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs
 - Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress
 - Amygdala the alarm circuit of fear
 - Chemo-receptors in brain-stem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain 
 - Chemo-receptor flexibility is part of what distinguishes good and great athletes
 - Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of respiratory gases in the body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.
 - "If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath beater"
 - humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage. 
 - Mouth-breathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep
 - Mouth-breathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brain secretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.
 - If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more. 


# Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History (Patrick Hunt)
 - Rosetta Stone - key to Egyptian writing: hieroglyphs
 - Troy - Discipline of archaeology started here. Soil and whats in it also can be read like books. Established truth behind Homeric poems.
 - Nineveh Library - Collection of 20k tablets form 1st military empire: Assyrians. Known for cruelty. Capital city burned. 
 - Machu Picchu - Spectacular natural beauty. Hidden city of Incas Peru. 
 - King tuts tomb - Superstar in modern world, barely relevant to ancient Egypt. Riches in minor tomb staggering even to modern standards. 
 - Pompeii - Eyewitness record of eruption. City well-preserved, mid existence. Tells us much about ancient Roman life. ("More Important than Rome")
 - Dead Sea Scrolls - Oldest biblical documents. Odd history of being kept from public.
 - Thera - Possibly Atlantis. Minoan island that different volcanic eruption.
 - Olduvai gorge - The key to human evolution. Most distant human relatives
 - Tomb of 10k warriors - Key to understanding how China unified. 

# Extreme Ownership (Jocko Wilnick) 
- Very good
- Overly wordy, but many good points
- Extreme Ownership: 

  > requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans

  > requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure

 - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
 - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance
 - Ego clouds/disrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own) 
 - *Cover and Move*: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"
 - "Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)
 - For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process
 - *Commanders Intent* most important part of brief
 - Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in
 - Best teams employ constant analysis of tactics and measure effectiveness to adapt
   > Done through post-operational debrief. What went right ? wrong ? more effective ?
 - Paramount that senior leaders explain to jr leaders their role and how it fits the big picture
 - One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your Boss. 
 - Factors for leadership (leading up and down the chain of command)
   > Take responsibility for everyone in your world: subordinates and superiors

   > If someone isn't doing what you want/need, determine what you can do to enable

   > Dont ask your lead what you should do, tell them what you are going to do
 - Dichotomy of Leadership (see 80/20 and diminishing returns)
   > Confident not cocky 
   
   > Leader and follower
   
   > Quiet not silent

   > competitive but gracious

   > humble not passive

   > calm not robotic 

   > attentive but not obsessed by detail

   > aggressive not over-bearing

   > Extreme Ownership vs Decentralized Command
 - This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.
 - Dont do the leadership "comb-over"
 - Good performance comes from Rehearsal
 - When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
    > "Why am I intimidated by this situation? "

    > Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader. 
 -  IF you have a weak leader: LUCKY YOU! 
    > Have an opportunity to take advantage and LEAD
    
    > Do what you want. Motivate yourself ! Take charge. Take advantage. 
 - Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.
 - The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it
 - Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do. 
 - When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: That's a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"


# Mental Models Part 1 (The knowledge project)
  - See mental models section

# Hacking Darwin (Metzl) 
  - Average. Good start, very repetitive, lot of fluff (could have been 1/2 as long) 
  - 3.8B years ago single cell organisms emerged.
  - Sex invented 1.3B years ago (accelerated evolution) 
  - Claim: Now the principles of Darwinian evolution are evolving 
  - Will soon see conception through sex as unnecessarily dangerous
  - Humans have about 21k genes, 3.2B base pairs
  - epigenetics regulates how our DNA is expressed
  - "Worlds most valuable resource no longer oil, but data"
  - Generalized Medicine (based on population averages) will be seen to be the equivalent of leaches. 
  - Wont need complete understanding (of healthcare or genetics) to deploy growing knowledge w/confidence.
  - 500B sperm cells for men vs 400 total eggs for women. 
  - sperm and eggs have been generate from skin cells and used to give birth to healthy mice. 
  - Scientists already viable offspring from two male mice. 
  - Wild chicken: 1egg/ month  Domesticated 30/month (Only 8k years to change without "Bio Tech")
  - Most cells in your body turn over every two years (on average) 
  - 28 years for humans to pass a generation 6 months for chickens
  - Breeding preimplented embryos with each other can accelerate the turn over in humanss. 
  - Artcic apples can be sliced and left out with out browning b/c scientists have used CRISPER to silence genes controlling browning
  - 37 genes are in the mitochondria. 
  - Aging is probably a combination of many different systems in the body all decaying at different rates
  - Aging is the leading cause of death among humans (diseases that kill us most are from aging. Curing any one will not help much) 
  - Eliminating cancer will buy us 3 years
  - "Ive only had one wrinkle in my life, and Im sitting on it" - Jean Calment (122) 
  - Lifestyle choices significantly impact the epigenetic instructions 
  - "Nature is clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel" - Darwin
  - We will never have perfect knowladge of the genome just like we never had perfect knowladge of fire before we started harnessing it, cancer before we started treating it,  or domesticated crops before we started eating them
  - Optimism and hubris is built into our operating systems 
  - Bostrom's "Reversal Test" - If some people feel that making a change in one direction is bad, they should articulate why doing the opposite (actively) would be justified. 
  - Euginics 60k Americans were sterilized without acquiescence / Nazis did 400k Germans
  - Diversity has been and remains sole survival strategy of our species
