# The Denial of Death (Earnest Becker)
  - Interesting found it too speculative in places.
  - Seemed to be speaking to very specific field in places (eg: why do I /should I care what Freud was like as a person?)
  - Places great faith (with out justification) in psychoanalysis.
  - The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles would be over. Now we are choking in truth.
  - Knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction. Insignificant fragments are magnified out of proportion, while major and historical insights lie around begging for attention.
  - The experts give us manageable thrills- if they thrill us at all.
  - Narcissism is what keeps men marching into  point blank cannon fire in wars.
  - Civilized society is a hopeful belief and protest that science and and goods "make men count" for mare than any other animal. In this sense, everything that man does is religious and heroic and yet in danger of being fictitious and fallible.
  - The crisis of modern society is that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that culture has set up
  - Children have no knowledge of death until 3-5
  - From the child of 5 to myself is but a step, but from the newborn baby to the child of 5 is an appalling distance.
  - Nothing like the essence of man has been found.
  - Mans self-consciousness makes man a small god in nature, yet at the same time man is a worm and food for worms. This duality is a painful contradiction. Lower animal spared this contradiction. (Q: Are we spared other painful contradictions from our limited knowledge/being ?
  - We are gods with anuses
  - The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body.
  - Most people tranquilize themselves in the trivial.
  - Man has an inner symbolic self which signifies certain freedom, but he is bound by a finite body which limits that freedom.
  - The self must be destroyed, brought down to nothing, in order for self-transcendence to begin. Then the self can begin to relate to powers beyond itself.
  - Man is the only organism in nature fated to puzzle out what it actually means to feel "right"
  - The most remarkable achievement in the Christian world picture: anyone can be a secure hero simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things: heaven.
  - Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to procreate.
  - as soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffing at eternal problems like life and death... he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just as society maps these problems out for them.
  - All throughout history it is the "normal, average men" who, like locusts, have laid waste to the world in order to forget themselves.
  - Salpetrice mental hospital got cleared out at the time of the French Revolution. All the neurotics found a ready-made donor of self-transcending action and heroic identity.
  - The promise of Psychology was that it would usher in the era of happiness of man, by showing him how things worked, how one things causes another. Then all man had to do was take possession of these and his happiness would be assured.
  - All the analysis in the world doesn't allow a person to find out "who he is" or why he is here on earth, why he has to die, how he should live. It is when psychology pretends to do this (when it pretends to offer itself as full explanation for human unhappiness) that it becomes a fraud.
  - Religion is "just as good a psychology" as the psychology that pretended to replace it.
  - Modern man needs a to turn to for spiritual dependence, as God is unfashionable in steps the therapist.
  - Claim: after the most exhaustive psychology quest, psychology gives way to theology
  - (DFW echos)  It is one thing to image this (theological) cure, but it is quite another thing to "prescribe" it to modern man. How hollow it must ring in his ears.
  - Freud: All cultural devices are self-hypnotic contrivances - from cars to moon rockets - ways that a surely limited animal can fascinate himself in an attempt to transcend reality.
  - The most one can achieve is a certain relaxedness an openness to experience that makes him less of a driven burden on others.
  - When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness.
  - The closing pages of this book are a realistic and regretful admission that the ego has to spread itself beyond the pleasures of the body in order for men to be men.


# Thinking about Mathematics (Stewart Shapiro)
  - Very good. Not actionable, but very interesting.
  - Come down with Structuralism
  - Classical logic and impredicative definitions are thoroughly entrenched in contemporary mathematics. Accepted not b/c sanction philosophically, but b/c smooth practice of math needs them.
  - Lowenheim-Skolem Theorems: Notions of natural number finitude, ect. cannot be captured in 1st order theories. Any 1st order theory, if it has infinite models, has unintended models that get these notions wrong.
  - Virtually all of math can be rendered in the language of set-theory, and all known theorems in math can be proved in ZFC (a version of set theory). However many interesting and important questions cannot be decided by ZFC axioms. eg: Cantors Continuum Hypothesis
  - Incompleteness theorem: Realist says it shows there is no axiomatization whose theorems are all and only the truths of arithmetic.
    "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system"
    Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability
  - The incompleteness theorem shows that the undecidable sentence phi is truth of the natural numbers => we have an informal proof of the truth of the formally undecidable sentence. There is more to arithmetic provability than can be derived in any fixed formal axiomatization. => arithmetic truth and informal arithmetic provability both out run what can be produced by a machine.
  - Kant took philosophical measure of the new scientific 19th C developments. The result was a heroic attempt to explain the necessity of math and the apriori nature of mathematical truths, while explaining the place of math in the empirical sciences.
  - Kant claimed: Structure of mathematical reasoning due to the structure of our apparatus of perception.
  - Widely agreed that Kants philosophy of math failed from later developments in math and science eg: non-euclidean Geometry.
  - Frege committed to view that all propositions about numbers are knowable. (T or F)
  - More Incompleteness: Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove.
  - Most real numbers do not have names.
  - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency (More incompleteness)
  - How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
  - Structuralism: The essence of a natural number is its relation  to other numbers. The subject matter of arithmetic is a single abstract structure. Set theorist point out that the set theoretic hierarchy contains as many isomorphissms types as possible. that is the point of the theory.

# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.
