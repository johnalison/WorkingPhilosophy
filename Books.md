## Extreme Ownership](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/ (Jocko Wilnick) 
 - Very good
 - Overly wordy, but many good points
 - Extreme Ownership: 
 
   > requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans
 
   > requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure
 
 - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
 - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance
 - Ego clouds/disrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own) 
 - *Cover and Move*: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"
 - "Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)
 - For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process
 - *Commanders Intent* most important part of brief
 - Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in
 - Best teams employ constant analysis of tactics and measure effectiveness to adapt
   > Done through post-operational debrief. What went right ? wrong ? more effective ?
 - Paramount that senior leaders explain to jr leaders their role and how it fits the big picture
 - One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your Boss. 
 - Factors for leadership (leading up and down the chain of command)
   > Take responsibility for everyone in your world: subordinates and superiors

   > If someone isn't doing what you want/need, determine what you can do to enable

   > Dont ask your lead what you should do, tell them what you are going to do
 - Dichotomy of Leadership (see 80/20 and diminishing returns)
   > Confident not cocky 
   
   > Leader and follower
   
   > Quiet not silent

   > competitive but gracious

   > humble not passive

   > calm not robotic 

   > attentive but not obsessed by detail

   > aggressive not over-bearing

   > Extreme Ownership vs Decentralized Command
 - This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.
 - Dont do the leadership "comb-over"
 - Good performance comes from Rehearsal
 - When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
    > "Why am I intimidated by this situation? "

    > Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader. 
 -  IF you have a weak leader: LUCKY YOU! 
    > Have an opportunity to take advantage and LEAD
    
    > Do what you want. Motivate yourself ! Take charge. Take advantage. 
 - Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.
 - The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it
 - Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do. 
 - When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: That's a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"


## Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/ (Patrick Hunt)
 - Rosetta Stone - key to Egyptian writing: hieroglyphs
 - Troy - Discipline of archaeology started here. Soil and whats in it also can be read like books. Established truth behind Homeric poems.
 - Nineveh Library - Collection of 20k tablets form 1st military empire: Assyrians. Known for cruelty. Capital city burned. 
 - Machu Picchu - Spectacular natural beauty. Hidden city of Incas Peru. 
 - King tuts tomb - Superstar in modern world, barely relevant to ancient Egypt. Riches in minor tomb staggering even to modern standards. 
 - Pompeii - Eyewitness record of eruption. City well-preserved, mid existence. Tells us much about ancient Roman life. ("More Important than Rome")
 - Dead Sea Scrolls - Oldest biblical documents. Odd history of being kept from public.
 - Thera - Possibly Atlantis. Minoan island that different volcanic eruption.
 - Olduvai gorge - The key to human evolution. Most distant human relatives
 - Tomb of 10k warriors - Key to understanding how China unified. 


## Breath: the new science of a lost art](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/
 - Fantastic
 - 90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution) 
 - molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air") 
 - o2 produces 16x the energy than c02
 - Two ways body makes energy from air/food
 
   > w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout
 
   > w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks
 
 - Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue. 
 - Mouth breathing ##1 cause of cavities
 - Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity
 - Internal organs are malleable
 - We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.
 - We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2
 - CO2 is the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.
 - Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2
 - Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min
 - Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers
 - With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit. 
 - When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline
 - When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -> pH lower: more acidic.
 - All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.
 - Breathing is the power switch to the eautonomic nervous system. 
 - Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.
 - Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs
 - Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress
 - Amygdala the alarm circuit of fear
 - Chemo-receptors in brain-stem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain 
 - Chemo-receptors flexibility is part of what distinguishes good and great athletes
 - Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of respiratory gases in the body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.
 - "If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath better"
 - Humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage. 
 - Mouth-breathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep
 - Mouth-breathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brain secretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.
 - If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more. 


## David Foster Wallace Bio ("Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story")](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/
  - Good 
  - Serous mental problems, Big pot and alcohol problems, big into AA.
  - Interested in Buddhism
  - "The world is everything that is the case" (Tractatus. Wallace though one of the best opening lines in western it.)
    - Does our understanding of what we experience derive from objective reality or from cognitive limitations with us ? (Is language window or cage?)
  - Do we have real existence outside of what we do/say/perceive? Are these really under our control? 
  - Infinite Jest: 
  
    > Are we choosing what to love carefully enough ?
  
    > "Generation too afraid to say what it meant, and so in danger of fretting it had anything to say. 
  
    > Suddenly, for Wallace, sincerity was a virtue and saying what you meant a calling.
  
    > "One of the points of Infinite Jets is that the center is empty" (inside Hal there's pretty much nothing at all, he knows)
  
  - This is water
  
    > The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily conscious"
  
    > Learning how to think really means being aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to **choose** how you construct meaning from experience


## Fumble Rules (guide to grammar and usage)](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/
 - Overly clever, not enough actionable information.
 - Some of it: kill "with regard to", "with reference to", "on account of", "by means of", "as regards", "with the exception of"


## Stoic Test Challenge](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/ (William Irvine)
 - Great Book!
 - Definitely changed my life for the better. 
 - Philosophy of life: what in life is worth having and what is a strategy for obtaining it. 
 - Now w/after life, but about time on earth.
 - All about stoic tests (see Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy))
 - What up sets people is not the setbacks in themselves, but there judgements of them. 


## Breakfast of Champions](https://github.com/johnalison/WorkingPhilosophy/blob/master/BookNotes/ (Kurt Vonnegut)
 - Didn't really get it. Was obviously a lot of cleaver stuff going on, most of it was over my head. 
 - "I thank those lusts (of gold and seeing little girls underpants) for being so ridiculous for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything"
 - "Ideas on earth were badges of friendship. Friends agreed with friends to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with  enemies in order to express enmity."
 - "Seems like the only kind of job an American can get these days is committing suicide in some way"
 - I wont know myself until I find out whether life is serious or not"
