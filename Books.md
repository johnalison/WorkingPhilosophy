# The Epicurus Reader
  - Interesting, but not enough context, bailed early.
  - "The four part cure" - Dont fear god, Dont worry about death, What is good is easy to get, and what is terrible is easy to endure"
  - Epicurus says the fundamental obstacle to happiness is anxiety. No matter how rich and famous you are, wont be happy if you are anxious to be more rich/famous.
  - People who want more then they need are making a fundamental mistake. (causes needless anxiety) 
  - Epicurean Philosophy teaches how little you need, to enjoy possessing it, and to enjoy the confidence that you will continue to possess it.   
  - Discomfort that is chronic and intense is very unusual.
  - While you are alive, you dont have to deal with being dead, but when you are dead you dont have to deal with it either, b/c you dont exist. 
  - "Dont fear gods" role models are those who emulate the happiness of gods. Epicurus, "I am prepared to compete with Zeus in happiness as long as I have barley cake and some water"
  - It is stupid to do anything that would cause you to worry about anything. 
  - Becoming accustomed to simple, not extravagant ways of life makes one completely healthy, makes man unhesitant in the face of life's necessary duties, puts us in better condition for the times of extravagance and fearless in the face of chance. 
  - It is better to be unlucky in a rational way than lucky in a senseless way.
  - The things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. 
  - Necessity is a bad thing, but there is no necessity to live with necessity.
  - Live is ruined by delay and each one of us dies with out enjoying leisure.
  - To show reverence for the wise is itself a great good for him that reveres.
  - He who claims that everything happens by necessity has no complaint against him who claims that everything does not occur by necessity. For he makes that very claim by necessity. 
  - Nothing is enough for someone whom enough is little. 
  - In a joint philosophical investigation he who is defeated comes out ahead in so far as he has learned something new. 
  - The wise man will be grateful for being corrected.

# Writing GNU Emacs Extensions
  - Learned a lot about how Emacs works behind the scenes.
  - good practical example of how to write in lisp
  - "Emacs users are in the happy position of being their own tool smiths"
  - Emacs is really an editor builder -> General purpose interactive application builder.
  - Real Emacs users create a universe of new tools.


# How emotions are made (Lisa Barrett) 
  - Good start. Faded fast.   Bailed on last chapter. 
  - Too repetitive and vague he in places. Did not resonant with thrust of the argument.
  - Main point emotions are not some brute reflex at odds with our rationality ("Classical view of emotion")
  - Claims emotions are not what we think they are, but does little to say what they are. "Product of human agreement"
  - Historical record implies that ancient Romans did not smile when happy.  "Smile" does not exist in Latin. (Invention of the Middle ages) Toothy smiles became popular only in the 18C as dentistry became more accessible. 
  - You experience right now was predicted by your brain a moment ago. 
  - Events in the world merely tune you predictions.
  - 50% of the words we hear cannot be understood out of context. 
  - Emotions not reactions to the world, they are you reconstruction of the world.
  - One of our most notable adaptations is that we have genes that let our brain develop in the context of other brains (Culture!)
  - Darwin made an inexplicable about-face in "Expression of Emotion in man and animals" returning to essentialism, abandoning his previous innovation.
  - Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
  - The very words that help us to learn concepts can also trick us into believing that their categories reflect firm boundaries in nature. 
  - Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
  - In the last 20 years become clear that the immune system involved in far more illness than used to think.
  - Nocebo effect (Feel pain when no physical harm) Opposite of the placebo
  - Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
  - Children who experince early adversity and hardship have shorter telomeres.


# The Design of everyday things
  - Overall entertaining, didn't take much away.
  - Duty of machines and people who design them to understand people. Not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines
  - Accident at 3-mile island: problem was plants control systems
  - People themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they encounter. 
  - Most human behavior is the result of subconscious processes => Many of our beliefs about how people behave -- including ourselves -- are wrong. 
  - Tend to believe that thought can be separated from emotion. Wrong. Cognitive thoughts lead to emotion, emotions  drive thoughts. 
  - Cognition tries to make sense of the world, emotion assigns value. 
  - We often dont know what we are about to do, say, or think until after we have dont it. (Good reason to journal) 
  - We tend to use logic and reason after the fact to justify our decisions to ourselves and others. (What does this say about "interpretable AI"?) 
  - "Human error" usually the result of poor design. Should be called "System Error" 
  - Dont criticize unless you can do better.
  - B/c so much knowledge is in the environment, surprising how little we need to learn. People can do well and still be unable to describe what they do. 
  - Profoundly erroneous truism, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them" - whitehead
  - Metric system was developed by the French in the 1790s, yet 3 countries still resist its use: USA, Liberia, and Myanmar. 
  - Early plastics were designed to look like wood. 
  - A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all. 
  - Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them.  They start by trying to understand what the real issues are. 
  - Most companies compare features with companies to strengthen weaknesses. Better strategy to concentrate on areas where they are stronger and to strengthen them even more, Then focus marketing on strengths. 
  - Reading far faster than listening in terms of acquiring info. 
  - Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out which parts DIDN'T fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 


# The Button (William Perrry and Tom ?) 
   - Very good / Learned a lot/ lot of overlap with previous Perry book / Bit repetitive
   - Under current US policy presidents have authority to launch nukes 1st and is not limited to retaliation! (Can be launched with in mins) 
   - Once launched cannot be recalled. 
   - The threat of Russia launching attack on US is vanishingly small, smaller than the risk that we might start war by mistake => current nuclear policy is very dangerous. (ESP given that it is susceptible to cyber attack)) 
   - Short of mutiny, no one can stop president launching nukes for whatever reason. 
   - Only 25% of public knows president has sole authority
   - Putting this much power in the hand of one person goes against everything the constitution stands for.  Congress has sole power to declare war. Lincoln: "No one man should hold the power to take us to war"
   - Risks of having nukes ready to launch on minutes notice outweigh any perceived benefits. System is unconstitutional, dangerous, outdated and unnecessary. 
   - Original rationale of sole authority nothing to do with using them quickly. Everything to do with guarding against over-zealous generals. 
   - Fixed location of ICBMs are known, unlike subs. Only way for ICBMs to survive 1st strike form Russia is if fired on warning. (Extremely dangerous b/c we know warning system fallible) 
   - Climate science => Full scale nuclear attach suicidal even if no retaliation.
   - Risk of surprise attack  << Risk of stumbling into war
   - 1982 Soviets declared for 1st time that would not use nukes first (Us has never said as much...)
   - A nuclear war by mistake would be just as deadly as one by intent. 
   - Nixon ordered a tactical nuclear strike on North Korea after they downed a spy plane. Kissinger intervened and settled the situation down until NIXON WAS SOBER. 
   - Stuxnet: First attack of a major nature which was used  to cause serious physical damage. 
   - Cyber threats, which did not exist when the systems were built, dramatically increase the danger of accidental nuclear war. 
   - If we cannot be confident that systems will work under attack (eg: if systems taken offline by cyber attack)  what does this say about the viability of nuclear deterrence ?
   - If no sane president would even order the 1st use of the bomb, then why does US policy allow 1st use ? It should not.   
   - US plans to spend 2 trillion over next 30 years on nukes. 
   - ICBMs Russia knows where they are, and would knock them out 1st. Bombers and subs protect and act as a deterrence, not ICBMs. 
   - US doesn't not need ICBMs and should phase them out without replacement. Would save $ 150B  would take "missile states" out of cross-hairs and would remove and accidental threat. 
   - The triad (ICBMs/subs/ bombers) emerged mainly from inter-service rivalry. 
   - Nukes are the only immediate existential threat to the US. 
   - Combined Test Ban. still in limbo. US not test nuke since 92. but the treaty does not come into force until the US ratifies. US led the world to negotiate the treaty, but cannot get organized enough to sign it. 


# The scientific revolution : Aspirations and Achievements
  - Acording to Aristotle, it is a matter of observation that the heavens never change. They must therefore be composed of an oncorruptible 5th element: ether.
  - An argument agianst Aristarchus' helocentric model was that the stars were always observed to be in the same position relative to the earth at all times of day and year => earth doesnt move. Aristarchus countered that the stars are infinitely far away. 
  - The stoics were rigidly deterministic. 
  - Three developments that encouraged the skeptics: The reformation / the discovery of the new world / recent publication of ancient texts of skeptics
  - Astronomers observed a bright new star in 1572 and a new coment 5 years later. In both cases, careful observation made it clear that these phenomena were super lunary. 
  - Mersenne posulated (for 1st time) that the workd can usefully be concieved of as a machine whose working is to be explained mathematically. 
  - Descartes 1st to arrive at the principle of inertia. 
  - Descartes had a (deeply flawed) model of the behavoour of stars and planets that was truly mechanical. 
  - In the second half of the 17C England was transformed from a hereditary monarchy into a constitutional government in which King was limited by Parliament. 
  - Boyle described experiments that failed. 

# Sapiens 
  - Outstanding!
  - Timeline: 3e9 ya Beginning of Biology / 7e4 Cognitive revolution (Beginning of History)  / 1e4 Agricultural revolution / 5e3 1st kingdoms / 5e2 scientific revolution (entire planet single historical event) / 2e2 industrial revolution
  - Present: organisms increasingly shaped by intelligent design rather than natural selection
  - Scientific revolution may well end history and start something different (Reason that now is different) 
  - Most important thing about prehistory humans: They were insignificant animals with no more impact on the environment than other animals.
  - Chimps closest ancestor: split 6e6 ya
  - Human Brain: ~3% of body weight / but 25% energy use (Only ~8% energy use in other apes) 
  - Women who gave birth earlier when the infants head was smaller fared better / lived to have more children (humans are born prematurely) 
    This contributed greatly both to humans extraordinary social abilities and to its unique social problems. Raising children required constant help from family members and neighbors. 
    Since born underdeveloped, humans can be educated and socialized to a far greater extent than other animals
  - Humans position in the food chain (until quite recently) was solidly in the middle
  - In the last 1e5 years, we have leaped to the top of the food chain. This has had enormous consequences. Changed so fast that the ecosystem could not adjust.  
    We are full of fears and anxieties over our new position. 
  - Cooking inadvertently opened the way to big brains in humans. (Hard to have both big brain and long intestines)
  - Cognitive revolution: new ways of thinking and communicating. 3-7e5 ya
  - Can never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven. 
  - Sapiens can cooperate in extraordinarily flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. This is why sapiens rule the world.
  - How did humans eventually found cities with 1e5 people and empires with 1e8 people ? Probably from fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate by believing in common myths. 
  - There are no gods, no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside of the common imagination of human beings. 
  - Corporations among humans most ingenious inventions. Legally independent of people who set them up. Became the main players in the economy. Often forget they exist only in our imaginations. 
  - Since the cognitive revolution humans have been living in a dual reality. 
       Objective: rivers/ trees / lions    Imagined: gods/nations and corporations
  - Since the cognitive revolution we have been able to revise behavior rapidly in accordance with changing needs (fast forward evolution) 
     eg: Catholic Church survived for centuries not by passing on genes, but stories. 
  - Cognitive revolution: History separates from biology. Narrative is now primary means of explaining the development of humans (Not biological theories) 
  - Real differences between us and chimps is the mythical glue that binds us. 
  - Our brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. 
  - Foragers where less likely to suffer starvation and were more healthy than their peasant descendants.
  - The stories that foragers told themselves is one of the biggest holes in understanding human history. 
  - Among all the worlds large creatures, the only survivors will be humans and the farmland creatures that are our slaves.
  - Agricultural revolution 1e5 ya
  - >90% of the calories we eat come from a handful of plants and animals our ancestors domesticated between 9k BCE - 3k BCE. 
     (There has been no noteworthy plant or animal domesticated in 2e3 years) 
  - Scholars once claimed agricultural revolution as a great leap forward for humanity. Fantasy! No evidence people became more intelligent. AR => harder lives for those who lived through it.
  - Plants domesticated humans, not the other way around.
  - The AR made the future far more important than it had even been before.
  - If we dont believe in God, creation and souls, how/why are people equal? 
  - "Biological Declaration of Independence": We hold these truths ... self-evident, that all men evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics, and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure"
  - An imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them
  - Slave trade: Paradoxically genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority; precisely because the Africans were fitter in tropical climates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European masters.
  - Biology enables, culture forbids
  - Even among chimps the alpha male wins his position by building a stable coalition with other males and females, not through mindless violence.
  - How did it happen that in the one species whose success depends above all on cooperation, individuals who are supposedly less cooperative (men) control individuals who are supposedly more cooperative (women) ? At present we have no good answer.
  - Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.
    The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.
  - Consistency is the playground of dull minds.
  - Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset.
  - The 1st millennium BC witnessed the appearance of three potentially universal order, whose devotees could for the first time imagine the entire world and the entire human race as a single unit governed by a single set of laws: Monetary order / Imperial order / order of universal religions.
  - Money is a psychological construct.  Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. Money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.
  - Whereas religion asks us to believe in something, money asks us to believe that *other people believe in something*
  - Money is the apogee of human tolerance. Money more open minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits.
  - Contemporary critique of empires: they do not work / they are evil. First statement is non-sense, the second is deeply problematic. To color all empires black and to disavow all imperial legacies is to reject most of human culture.
  - Empire has been the worlds most common form of political government for the last 2500 years
  - Monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the universe -- and He's evil.
  - The central figure in Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha Guatama.
  - No matter what people achieve they are never content.  Suffering is caused by behavior patterns in ones own mind. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering.  Meditation trains the mind to focus all its attention on the question "What am I experiencing now?"  rather than on "What would I rather be experiencing?" 
  - The first principle of monotheistic religions is "God exists. What does He want from me?" The first principle of Buddhism is "Suffering exists. How do I escape it?"
  - If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on beliefs in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.
    The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of natural-law religions such as liberalism, Communism, nationalism, and Nazism.
  - Humanism is a belief that Homo Sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally different form the nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Humanists believe that the unique nature of human beings ins the most important thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe.
  - The liberal belief in the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the traditional christian belief in free and eternal individual souls. Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly difficult for liberals to explain  what is so special about individual Sapiens.
  - Social humanism is built on monotheist foundations. The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the monotheistic conviction that all souls are equal before God.
  - Our liberal political and judicial system are founded on the belief that every individual has a sacred inner nature, indivisible and immutable, which gives meaning to the world,  and which is the source of all ethical and political authority. Yet over the last 200 years, the life sciences have thoroughly undermined this belief. Scientist have found no soul, they argue behavior is determined by hormones, genes and synapses, rather than by free will.  Our judicial and political systems largely try to sweep such inconvenient discoveries under the rug. How long can we maintain the way separating the department of biology from the departments of law and political science.
  - One of the distinguishing marks of history - the better you know a particular historical period the *harder* it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not another.
  - Unlike physics or economics, history  is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.
  - Cultures are a kind of mental infection or parasite with humans as its unwitting host
  - Coping with the scientific revolution: Our current assumption that we do not know everything, and that even the knowledge we possess is tentative, extends to the shared myths that enable millions of strangers to cooperate effectively.  If the evidence shows that many of those myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together ?  All modern attempts to stabilize the sociopolitical order have had no choice but to rely on either of two unscientific methods: 1) Take a scientific theory, and in opposition to common scientific practices, declare that it is a final and absolute truth (Nazis, Communists) 2) Leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientific absolute truth (liberal humanism).
  - Most ancient myth to come down to us - the Gilgamesh myth of ancient Sumer (defeat death). 
  - In 1775 Asia accounted for 80% of the world economy.
  - European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history. Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. European imperialists set out in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories.
  - The first modern man was Amerigo Vespucci, who argued that the islands discovered by Columbus were not islands off the East Asian coast, but rather an entire continent unknown to Scriptures, classical geographers , and contemporary Europeans.
  - Poetic Justice: 1/4 of the world is named after a little-known Italian whose sole claim to fame is that he had the courage to say "We dont know"
  - Discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favor present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged the Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed.
  - Not one expedition of either exploration or conquest was ever sent to America from the Islamic world, India or China. The first non-European power that tried to send a military expedition to America was Japan in 1942.
  - What enables banks - and the entire economy - to survive and flourish is our trust in the future.
  - Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future.  The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or know how to use it. It was that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn't trust the future would be better than the present.
  - Adam Smiths claim that the selfish human urge to increase profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history - revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, bet even more so from a moral and political perspective.
  - Capitalism's belief in perpetual economic growth flies in the face of almost everything we know about the universe. Banks and governments print money, but ultimately, it is the scientists who foot the bill.
  - There is no such thing as a market free of all political bias. The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves, and charlatans. Markets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft and violence.
  - The rise in European capitalism went hand in hand with the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. Unrestrained market forces, rather than tyrannical kings or racist ideologues, were responsible for this calamity. The slave trade was not controlled by any state or government. It was a purely economic enterprise, organized and financed by the free market according to the laws of supply and demand. Private slave-trading companies sold shares on major stock exchanges. Middle-class Europeans looking for a good investment bought these shares.   
  - When growth becomes a supreme good, unrestricted by any other ethical considerations, it can easily lead to catastrophe.
  - The Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. Before the Industrial Revolution, since human and animal bodies were the only energy conversion device available, muscle power was the key to all human activities. Every few decades or so we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of energy available to us keeps growing.
  - Chemists discovered Aluminum only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from its ore was extremely difficult and costly. For decades Al more expensive than gold. In 1860s, Emperor Napoleon III commissioned aluminum cutlery for his finest guests, less important visitors had to make due with gold
  - The IR was above all else the second agricultural revolution: without the industrialization of agriculture the urban IR could never have taken place.
  - Ironically, the same scientific disciplines which shape our milk machines and egg machines have lately demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that mammals and birds have a complex sensory and emotional make-up. They not only feel physical pain, but can also suffer emotional distress.
  - The basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and reproduction.
  - Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world.
  - Capitalist-consumerist ethic: "Invest!" and "Buy!" This is the first religion in history whose followers actually do what they are asked to do.
  - German physicists found a way to determine the weather conditions in London based on tiny differences in the tone of the broadcast rings of big Ben.
  - The most momentous social revolution that ever befell humankind is the collapse of the family and the local community and their replacement by the state and the market. Millions of years of evolution have designed us to live and think as community members. Within a mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals. Nothing testifies better to the awesome power of culture.
  - These days every year is revolutionary. Today, even a thirty-year old can honestly tell disbelieving teenagers "When I was young, the was completely different".
  - During the last 70 years, humankind has for the first time faced the possibility of complete self-annihilation and has experienced a fair number of actual wars and genocides. Yet these decades were also the most peaceful era in human history- by a wide margin. This is surprising because these very same decades experienced more economic, social and political change than any previous era. The tectonic plates of history are moving at a frantic pace, but the volcanoes are mostly silent.
  - Wealth today consists mainly of human capital and organizational know-how. It is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military force. The few full-scale international wars that still take place in the world, eg Middle east, occur in places were wealth is old-fashioned material wealth.
  - Ours is the first time in history that the world is dominated by a peace-loving elite - politicians, business people, intellectuals and artists which genuinely see war as both evil and avoidable.
  - Did the wealth humankind accumulated in the last 5 centuries translate into a new-found contentment? If not, what is the point of developing agriculture, cities, writing, coinage, empires, science and industry ? Historians seldom ask these questions, yet they are the more important questions one can ask of history.
  - The brief golden age of the last half-century may turn out to have sown the seeds of future catastrophe.
  - We can congratulate ourselves with on the unprecedented accomplishments of modern Sapiens only if we completely ignore the fate of all other animals.
  - Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being and between bad marriages and misery.
  - The most important finding regarding happiness is that it doesn't not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or community. Rather it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.  Being satisfied with what you already have is far more important that getting more of what you want.
  - People are made happy by one thing and one thing only -- pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who just won the lottery or found new love jumps from joy is not really reaction to the money or the lover. She is reaction to various hormones coursing throughout her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signal flashing between different parts of their brain.
  - Happiness and miser play a role in evolution only to the extent that they encourage or discourage survival and reproduction.
  - There is only one historical development that has real significance. Today, when we finally realize that the keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical system, we can focus on the only that that can make us truly happy: manipulating our biochemistry. Prozac, for example, does not change regimes, but by raising serotonin levels it lifts people out of their depression.
  - Money, social status, plastic surgery, beautiful houses, powerful positions - none of these will bring you happiness.  Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine oxytocin.
  - If we accept the biological approach to happiness, then history turns out to be of minor importance, since most historical events have had no impact on our biochemistry.
  - To be happy is no more and no less than experiencing pleasant bodily sensations.
  - A meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship, whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.
  - Although the people in all cultures and eras have felt the same types of pleasures and pains, the meaning they ascribed to their experiences has probably varied widely. If so, the history of happiness might have been far more turbulent than biologists imagine. Its a conclusion that does not necessarily favor modernity.
  - As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. *Any* meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion.  Counter point: the beginning of infinity, science, humanity. 
  - Buddhism has assigned the question of happiness more importance than perhaps any other human creed. For 2500 years, Buddhists have systematically studied the essence and causes of happiness. Buddhism shares the basic insight of the biological approach, namely that happiness results from processing occurring within one's body, and not form events in the outside world.
  - If I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles. According to Buddhism, the root of suffering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather the real root of suffering is th e never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit the mind in never satisfied. People are liberated from suffering not when they experience this or that fleeting pleasure, but rather when they understand the impermanent nature of all their feelings, and stop craving them. This is the aim of Buddhist meditation practices. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied.
  - This idea is so alien to modern liberal culture that when Western New Age movements encountered Buddhist insights, they translated them into liberal terms. "Happiness begins within" This is exactly what biologists argue, but more or less the opposite of what Buddha said. Buddha agreed with biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions.  Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Buddha's recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings. 
  - If Buddhism is right, our entire understanding of the history of happiness might be misguided. Maybe it isn't so important whether peoples expectations are fulfilled and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings. The main question is whether people know the truth about themselves.
  - Most history books say nothing about how the course of history has influenced the happiness and suffering of individuals. This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history.
  - History is the next stage in the continuum of physics to chemistry to biology.
  - Homo sapiens are transcending biologically determined limits. It is now beginning to break the laws of natural selection, replacing them with the laws of intelligent design. The first crack in the old regime appeared 10k years ago in the Agriculture revolution. Sapiens who dreamed of fat, slow-moving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock, some of the offspring would be both fat and slow. It was a race of chickens unknown to nature, produced by intelligent design not of a god but of a human.
  - Today the 4 billion year old regime of natural selection is facing a completely different challenge: scientists are directly engineering living beings.
  - The Scientific Revolution may prove itself far greater than a mere historical revolution. It may turn out to be the most important biological revolution since the appearance of life on earth. If this happens, the whole of human history up to that point might, with hindsight, be reinterpreted as a process of experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionized the game of life. Such a process should be understood from a cosmic perspective of billions of years, rather than from a human perspective of millennia. 
  - Biologists are right about the past, but  the proponents of intelligent design might, ironically, be right about the future.
  - The Cognitive Revolution that turned Homo sapiens from an insignificant ape into the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in the physiology or even the size of and external shape of the Sapiens brain. It apparently involved no more than a few small changes to internal brain structure. Perhaps another small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive Revolution, create a completely new type of consciousness, and transform Homo Sapiens into something altogether different.
  - The last days are fast approaching. Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, the pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques, but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds. (It may take a few millennia, but from the the perspective of 70k years of Sapiens history, what are a few millennia?)
  - What do we want to become? This question dwarfs the debates that currently preoccupy politicians, philosophers, scholars and ordinary people. After all, today's debates between today's religions, ideologies, nations and classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo Sapiens. And yet the great debates of history are important because at least the first generation of the new gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human designers.
  - the implication of creating a mind in a computer are far more dramatic than curing psychiatric illness. This is why the Gilgamesh project is the flagship of science. It serves to justify everything science does.
  - "What do we want to want? " Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven't given it enough thought.
  - Modern Humans: Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We a consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction. Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who dont know what they want ?
  - Humans are gods to other animals (not benevolent ones!)



# Caffeine (Audio Book)
  - Short but sweet
  - Caffeine is the only drug we regularly give our children (in pop)
  - By far the most widely used psychoactive drug.
  - Plants use caffeine to drug bees into pollinating their flowers even if the plants are out of nectar. (Good for plant, bad for bee)
  - Question arises about humans. Coffee plants have clearly benefited. Not clear if net positive for humans.
  - Improved society in 17C for sure:
    - It was boiled, made safe for drinking.
    - Has some anti microbial features
    - Improves focus/concentration
    - Substitute for booze
    - Laxative (Constipation was a big problem in the 17C)
  - Probably very detrimental to our sleep
    - half-life of 6 hours in our system (1/4 life 12hrs)
    - Addictive: Coffee is the cure for the problem it causes
  - Arabs  had monopoly on coffee plant (were making a killing)
    - Dutchman smuggled it out to Java (This was the seed for most of coffee in the new world)
  - Charles II tried to ban coffee houses in England, was afraid that it would foment revolution. People ignored him. 


# How to decide (By Annie Duke)
  - Average overall. Learned something, but much of it was at too low of a level.
  - Only two things determine how your life turns out; luck and the quality of your decisions (You only have control over one of these)
  - Unlikely to have a class on decision making until college or beyond.
  - We dont even have a common language for talking about decision making.
  - Using your "gut" to decide: Cant know whether you've "used" it properly, all you can see is the output.
  - Where not good at recognizing when sacrificing quality in decision making isn't a big deal.
     - "Knowing when the hammer is good enough is a meta skill worth developing"
     - "Knowing when its okay to save time is part of a good decision process"
  - The quality of the outcome casts a shadow over our ability to see the quality of the decision.
  - Making it a habit of asking yourself "If I where wrong, why would that be?"
      helps to approach your own beliefs with more skepticism (Reduce systematic uncertainty)
  - The happiness test: Will the outcome of your decision have any effect on happiness in a year? a month ? a year?
    If no, then you can speed up the decision with little cost.
  - "Free roll" decisions with asymmetry between upside and downside b/c potential losses are insignificant.
      (Mental model for spotting opportunities)
  - When a decision is hard that means its easy. The closeness of the options is what slowing you down. Actually this is a signal that you can go fast)
  - The lower the cost to quit, the faster you can go. Easier to unwind and choose something else. (Should think more in advance about option to quit)
  - Decision stacking: Can you make lower impact, easier to quit decisions that will teach you something before the high-impact one-way decision (Rent before buy)
  - "He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that" - John Stuart Mill


# Project Management for Dummies
  - Not very useful
  - Lot of obvious suggestions (mostly already doing)
  - Leader vs Manager
  - WBS - "Work breakdown structure" list of all thinkgs that need doing
  - Critical Path: Dont assign yourself (Project manager) to items on the critical path.
  - Dont assign other people to work on a task that you cant clearly describe.
  - Assign yourself the talkst that you do best. "Law of comparative advantage"
  - Posessing a trait is not enough, you must help others see that you posess it.
  - Honesty: telling what you believe to be the truth
  - Integrity: having agreement between what you say and do

# Electronics (A systems approach)
  - Generally very good. Gets to advanced topics quickly.
  - Some redundancy / unnecessary details / out of date
  - Want signal to have low output resistance, load to have high input resistance
  - Large variations in gain from active circuits (OpAmps) can be overcome by negative feedback.
  - MOSFETs require very small area of Si. Resistors use large area should be avoided where possible on (ICs)
  - Power in CMOS determined by small current that flows when switching.
  - Shift registers used to convert parallel words into stream of bits on single line "Serial data". Can be used "backwards" to generate parallel data from serial input.
  - Although very large numbers of devises could be combined with in single chip, difficult to identify circuits that could be used in large numbers to justify development cost. Intel found a solution in 1971 with the programable microprocessor.


# SCRUM (Jeff Sutherland)
  - Good book overall. Could have been a lot shorter. too many examples / too much bragging / I think the idea. Would be interesting to try to implement
  - Only problem with Gantt charts: they are always wrong.
  - Gantt charts used to plan WWI (developed just prior)
  - Main idea: Whenever you start a project why not regularly check in to see if heading in the right direction/is actually what people want.
  - 80% of the value of any piece of software in 20% of the features.
  - People > process / Produts that work > documenting specs / Collaborating > negotiating / responding to change > following a plan
  - Three daily questions: What did you do since last meeting ? What are you going to do next ? What is getting in your way ?
  - That very large groups do LESS seems to be an iron clad rule of human nature.
  - Chaging TEAM performance mucn more important (by orders of magnitude) than changing individual performance.
  - Dont look for bad people, look for bad systems - one that incentivize bad behaviours and reward poor performance
  - Time makes up your life, wasting it is a form of suicide.
  - A team that depends on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines is not working the way it should.
  - Normal Project Management Planning is stupid because people are so bad at predicting how much work something requires.
  - Key to refine they plan THROUGHOUT they project, rather than do it all up front.
  - What is the little improvement that can be done right away that will make things better?
  - He who will defend everything, defends nothing.


# Map and Territory (Yudakoskwi)
  - Very good
  - Series of lesswrong blog posts written up.
  - Rationality is about fixing the systematic errors human brains tend to make, or finding workarounds
  - Our ability to control our muscles is evolutionary ancient, our ability to reason about our own reasoning processes is much more recent innovation
  - The inner-eye isnt sightless, though it sees blurrily with systematic distortion.
  - That which can be destroyed by the truth should be, that which the truth nourishes should thrive.
  - Science: reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the content of your mind mirror the content of the world.
  - Science: an understandable process that correlates human brains with reality.
  - Human Brain: flawed lens that can understand its own flaws and apply high-order corrections. This (when practiced) make the lens far more powerful.
  - To anticipate sensory experiences as pricicely as possible we must posess beliefs that are not anticipations of snsory experience.
  - Modern concept of religion as purely ethical derives from every other areas having been taken over by better institutions. Ethics is whats left.
     Or rather, people think that ethics is left.
  - If you say the earth is flat, people will look at you like your crazy. yet if you say the Bible is your source of ethics, women will not slap you!
  - "Of course it matters who started the fight !"
  - "Applause light" Saying something that is so trite that the reversal sounds abnormal, then the unreversed statement is not conveying new information.
  - A belief is only really worthwhile if you could, in principle, be persuaded to belive otherwise.
  - The strength of a model is not what it can explain, but what it cant.
  - Mystery is a property of the questions, not the answers. (Ignorance exists in the map, not the territory)  
  - Better to say "Magic" than complexity or emergence, the latter create an illusion of understand. Wiser to say magic and create plaholder (TO DO)
  - If you are equally good at explaining all outcomes, you have 0 knowledge
  - Counter-intuitive: Given incomplete information, the optimal strategy of guessing the color of cards does not resemble a typical sequence.
    "A random key does not open a random lock, just because they are both random"
  - Do not attempt ling chains of reasoning or complicated plans - just simply too difficult (See SCRUM)
  - You need one whole hell of a lot of rationality before it does anythign but lead you into new and interesting mistakes.
  - One is taught that the password to the lightbulb is "electricity!"


# Influence (Robert Caldini)
  - Very good. Reads well, learned a lot
  - Six basic tactics to get compliance. Each governed by fundamental psychological principle that directs human behavior:
    Consistency / Reciprocation / Social Proof / Authority / Liking / Scarcity
  - Well known principle of human behavior: when we ask someone to do us a favor will be more successful if we provide a reason.
  - As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow more intricate and variable we will have to depend increasingly on shortcuts to handle them all.
  - Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.
  - Odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance most of us know very little about our own automatic behavior patterns
  - Contrast Principle: If second item fairly different from 1st, we will tend to see it more differently than it actually is.
  - We are human b/c our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in a honored network of obligation
  - Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule => they made sure thier members are trined to comply and believe in it.
  - Desire to be and look consistent is a highly potent weopn of social influence often causing us to act in ways contray to our best interest.
  - Social Proof: thinking short cut, find out what others think is correct (Also vulnerable to attack)
  - When we are unsure of ourselves, when there is uncertianty, we are most likely to look and to accept the actions of others as correct.
  - Fake applause at opera: "Claque" / "Chef de claque"
  - How to defend against authority : "Is this authority truly an expert ? " / "How trustful can we expect the expert to be here?"
  - With all six of these principles we are usually and efficiently correct.
  - They fact that news conveying the fact that a product is going to be scarce is itself (the news) scarse makes it esp. persuasive.
  - Knowing these weapons of persuasion is often not enough. Knowing is a congnitive thing, cognitive proecesses are supress by our emotional reactions to the different weapons.


# Freakonomics
   - Excellent. Exactly up my alley.
   - Morality represents the way that people would like the world to work, whereas economics represents how the world really does work.
   - Incentives are the cornerstone to modern life. Understanding them is the key to understanding just about any riddle.
   - The conventional wisdom is often wrong. Conventional wisdom often shoddily formed and devilishly difficult to see through
   - Dramatic effects often have distant, even subtle causes.
   - "Experts" use their informational advantage to serve their own agenda. However they can be beat at their own game.
   - Knowing what to measure and how to measure it, makes a complicate world much less so.
   - Any incentive is inherently a trade off. The trick is to balance the extremes.
   - So inscrutable is the arrangement of causes and effects in this world that a 2 penny duty on tea unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it, changes the conditions of all its inhabitants,
   - April 15th 1987, at midnight 7 million American children suddenly disappeared. Cause: The IRS changed a rule. Instead of listing the name of the dependent children, you now also had to provide a SSN (10% of all dependents vanished)
   - IF economics is a science primarily concerned with incentives, it is also a science of statistical tool to measure how people respond to those incentives.
   - Noticing where the conventional wisdom may be false - noticing perhaps the contrails of sloppy of self-interested thinking - is a nice place to start asking questions.
   - Romanian communist party rounded up women in their workplaces to administer pregnancy tests. If a women repeatedly failed to conceive she was forced to pay a "celibacy tax"
     Of all communist leaders deposed in the years around the Soviet collapse, only the Romanian lead met a violent death. (Claim: the unwanted children grew up to be violent)
   - To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is jarring.
   - Be honest about your weaknesses


 
# Awaken the Giant within
   - Average overall. Lots of duplication / useless examples.
   - Our belief are like unquestioned commands, telling us how things are, what is possible and impossible.
   - The best strategy in almost any case is to find a role model. Someone who's already getting the results you want and then tap into their knowledge.
   - Lots of people know what to do, but few actually do what they know.
   - Most people overestimate what they can do in a year, and underestimate what they can achieve in a decade.
   - 3 decisions that shape your destiny: What to focus on. / What things mean to you. / What to do.
   - Success truly is the result of good judgment. Good judgment is the result of experience, and experience is the result of bad judgment.
   - Success is the result of making small decisions.
   - A real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken action. If there's no action, you haven't truly decided.
   - Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. (Cultivate the art of flexibility)
   - Become a hunter (aficionado) of excellence
   - Most important belief: In order to succeed and be happy we've got to be constantly improving the quality of our lives, constantly growing and expanding.
   - The only security in life comes from knowing that every single day you are improving yourself in some way.
   - Q: What did I learn today ? What did I enjoy today? How did I contribute/improve?
   - Its not enough to have a good mind, the main thing is to use it well - Descartes
   - 20% of any change is knowing how, 80% is knowing why.
   - Emotion is created by motion.
   - The real key to life is being able to make yourself feel good when you dont feel good, or dont want to. You can do this instantly by using your body to change state.
   - Q: What am I happy about now? What could I be happy about if I wanted to be?
   - Model the habitual questions of people you respect.
   - When angry: what can I learn from this so this never happens again?
   - Words you habitually choose affect how you communicate with yourself and therefore what you experience.
   - If you get upset, you loose control
   - All perception of truth is a detection of an analogy.
   - Emotions are like an internal compass which points to your goals.
   - Cultivate the appreciation for all emotions
   - The direction were heading in is more important that individual results.
   - Only way for long-term happiness is to live by our highest ideals.
   - Any difficulty in decision making ultimately comes from being unclear in our values
   - Be more concerned about your character than your reputation. Character is what you really are, reputation is what others think you are
   - Only way to master your time is to organize your schedule each day to spend the majority of it doing things that are important.
   - Strive for balance, not perfection.



# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
   - Fantastic!  One of my favorite authors
   - In a world deluged by information, clarity is power.
   - Philosophy, religion and science all running out of time. People have debated the meaning of life for 1000s of years. We cannot continue this debate indefinitely. The looming ecological crises, the threat of WMDs, and the rise of technological revolution will not allow it.  AI and biotech are giving humanity the power to reshape and re-engineer life. Very soon somebody will have to decide how to use this power based on some implicit or explicit story about the meaning of life.
   - Humans think in stories, not facts, numbers or equations. The simpler the better.
   - In 1938 human offered 3 global stories to choose from: In 1968 just 2; in 1998 a single story, now we are down to 0 in 2018.
   - Much harder to struggle against irrelevance than exploitation.
   - People who reject the liberal story dont offer any coherent alternative.
   - Liberalism has no obvious answers to the biggest problems we face: ecological collapse and technical disruption
   - Economic growth will not save the ecosystem. Just the opposite, in fact, for economic growth is the cause of the ecological crises. And economic growth will not solve technological disruption for it is predicated on the invention of more and more disruptive tech.
   - Biochemistry: algorithms of the brain are far from perfect. They rely on heuristics, shortcuts and outdated circuits adapted from the African savanna rather than from the urban jungle.
   - Replacing all human drivers by computers is expected to reduce deaths and injuries by 90%.
   - The US army needs 30 people to operate every "unmanned" drone over Syria.
   - Since alpha_0 learned nothing from humans, many of its winning moves and strategies seems unconventional to the human eye. They are considered creative, in not downright genius.
   - alpha_0 went from utter ignorance to creative mastery in four hours without human help.
   - If people play an exceptionally creative move in human-only chess tournaments, the judges will often suspect that it can possible be a human move. In chess, creativity is already considered to be the hallmark of computers rather than humans!!!
   - Human kind had to develop completely new models - liberal democracy, communist dictatorship, and fascist regimes - and it took more than a century of terrible wars and revolutions to experiment with these models, separate the wheat from the chaff, and implement the best solutions. Child labor in Dickensian coal mines, the First World War, the Great Ukrainian Famine, constituted just a small part of the tuition fees that humankind had to pay for the Industrial Revolution.
   - This time around, the failed models that might result in nuclear wars, genetically engineered monstrosities, and a complete breakdown of the biosphere. We have to do better than we did in confronting the Industrial Revolution.
   - Referendums and elections are always about human feelings not about human rationality. If democracy were a matter of rational decision-making, where would be absolutely no reason to give all people equal voting rights - or perhaps any voting rights at all.
   - Once somebody gains the technological ability to hack and manipulate the human heart, democratic politics will mutate into an emotional puppet show.
   - Feelings are biochemical mechanisms that all mammals and birds use in order to quickly calculate probabilities of survival and reproduction. Feels are therefore not the opposite of rationality, they embody evolutionary rationality.
   - We dont feel the millions of neurons in the brain computing probabilities of survival and reproduction, so we erroneously believe that our feelings are the result of some mysterious "free will".
   - For all practical purposes, it was reasonable to argue that I have free will, which nobody outside of me could see. I could enjoy the illusion that I controlled my secret inner arena, while outsiders could never really understand what was happening inside me and how I make decisions.
   - We are now at the confluence of two immense revolutions. Biologists are deciphering the mysteries of the human body, and in particular of the brain and human feelings. At the same time computer scientists are giving us unprecedented data-processing power. When the biotech revolution merges with the infotech revolution, it will produce Big Data algorithms that can monitor and understand my feelings much better than I can.
   - "Trolley problems" up till now these arguments have had embarrassingly little impact on actual behavior.
   - Throughout history the limitations of actually enforcing laws provided a welcome check on the biases, mistakes and excesses of lawmakers.
   - We have bred docile cows that produce enormous amounts of milk but are otherwise far inferior to their wild ancestors. They are less agile, less curious, less resourceful. We are now creating tame humans that produce enormous amounts of data and function as very efficient chips in a huge data-processing mechanism, but these data-cows hardly maximize the human potential.
   - Improvements in biotechnology might make it possible to translate economic inequality into biological inequality.
   - At present, people are happy to give away their most valuable asset - their personal data - in exchange for free email services and funny cat videos. Its a bit like African and Native American tribes who unwittingly old entire countries to European imperialists in exchange for colorful beads and cheap trinkets.
   - How do you regulate the ownership of data ? This may well be the most important political question of our era.
   - Pundits often blame feelings of alienation on the decline of religious and national bonds, but losing touch with your body is probably much more important. Humans have lived for millions of years with out churches and without nation states.
   - We know of no upper limit to the size of a group  with which people can identify. Most present day nations include more people than the entire world population 10k years ago.
   - Nationalism has two parts to it, one easy, the other very difficult. The easy part is to prefer people like-us over foreigners. The hard part of nationalism is to sometimes prefer strangers over friends and relatives. Tax evasion and nepotism come naturally to us, but nationalism says they are a "corruption". The ability to feel loyal to this nebulous mass is a miracle of modern history. 
   - Democracy cannot really function without nationalism.
   - Total annihilation has a way of sharpening peoples minds, and thanks in no small measure to this existential threat, a global community gradually developed over and above the various nations, because only such a community could restrain the nuclear demon.   
   - Humankind today faces three common challenges that make a mockery of all national borders, and that can only be solved through global cooperation: the nuclear challenge, the ecological challenge, and the technological challenge.
   - The nuclear challenge: In 2016, fewer people died from human violence than from obesity, car accidents or suicide. This may well have been the greatest political and moral achievement of our times.
   - The ecological challenge: Humans have been around for 100s of thousands of years and have survived numerous ice ages and warm spells. However agriculture, culture, cities, and complex societies have existed for no more than 10k years. During this period, earths climate has been relatively stable. Any deviation from the current standard will present human societies with enormous challenges than have never encountered before. Since there is no national answer to the problem of global warming, some nationalist politicians prefer to believe that the problem does not exist.
   - The technological challenge:  There again is no national answer. After 4 billion years of organic life evolving by natural selection, science is ushering in the era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. We still share most of our bodily structures, physical abilities, and mental faculties with Neanderthals and chimpanzees. 
   - We now have a global ecology, a global economy, and a global science - but we are still stuck with only national politics. This mismatch prevents our political system from effectively countering our main problems.
   - There is no contradiction between globalism and patriotism. Patriotism isn't about hating foreigners. Patriotism is about taking care of your compatriots. And in the 21st century, in order to take good care of your compatriots you must cooperate with foreigners. So good nationalist should be good globalists.
   - Questions for political leaders: What actions will you take to ... lessen the risks of nuclear war? ... lessen the risks of climate change? .. regulate disruptive technologies such as AI and bio-engineering ? How do you see the world of 2040 ? What is your worst-case scenario, and what is your vision for the best-case scenario.
   - The victory of science over religion has been so complete that our very idea of religion has changed. We no longer associate religion with farming or medicine. This is also why the entire world has increasingly become a single civilization. When things really work, everybody adopts them. When you compare the economic policies of the Shiite Iran, Sunni Saudi Arabia, Hindu India, and Christian America, you just dont see that much of a difference. 
   - Marx argued, "religion is just a veneer". But people often identify with the decor, and peoples identities are a crucial historical force. Human power depends on mass cooperation, and mass cooperation depends on manufacturing mass identities - and all mass identities are based on fictional stories, not on scientific facts or even economic realities.
   - The Kamikaze relied on combating state-of-the-art technology with state-of-the-art religious indoctrination.
   - We are trapped between a rock and a hard place, Humankind now constitutes a single civilization, and problems such as nuclear war, ecological collapse, and technological disruption can only be solved on a global level. On the other hand, nationalism and religion still divide our human civilization into different and often hostile camps.
   - Immigration: Some cultures might be better than others.
   - Re Terrorism: a small coin in an empty jar makes a lot of noise. The very success of modern states in preventing political violence makes them particularly vulnerable to terrorism.
   - Human stupidity is one of the most important forces is history.  One potential remedy for human stupidity is a does of humility.
   - Monotheism was arguably one of the worst ideas in human history; from an ethical perspective, the birth of bigotry. Did not improve the moral standard of humans, but did make many people far more intolerant than before.
   - Does God exist ? That depends on which god you have in mind: the cosmic mystery or the worldly lawgiver?
   - After giving the name "God" to the unknown secrets of the cosmos, they then use this to somehow condemn bikinis and divorce.
   - To the best of our knowledge all of the sacred texts were written by imaginative Homo Sapiens. They are just stories invented by our ancestors in order to legitimize social norms and political structures.
   - I personally never cease to wonder about the mystery of existence. But I have never understood what it has to do with the niggling laws of Judaism, Christianity, or Hinduism. These laws were certainly very helpful in establishing and maintaining the social order for thousands of years. But in that, they are not fundamentally different from the laws of secular states and institutions.
   - Morality doesn't mean "following divine commands". It means reducing suffering. If you really understand how an action causes unnecessary suffering to yourself or others you will naturally abstain from it.
   - Every violent act in the world begins with a violent desire in somebody's mind, which disturbs that persons peace and happiness before it disturbs the peace and happiness of anybody else. If you were completely free of anger you would feel far better than if you murdered and obnoxious enemy. For some people a strong belief in a compassionate god that commands us to turn the other cheek may help in curbing anger. That's been and enormous contribution of religious belief to the peace and harmony of the world.
   - While human rights movements have developed a very impressive arsenal of arguments and defenses against religious biases and human tyrants, the arsenal hardly protects us against consumerist excesses and technological utopias.
   - Secular science has at least one big advantage over most traditional religions -- namely that it is not afraid of its own shadow.
   - Not only rationality, but individuality too is a myth. Humans rarely think for themselves. Rather we think in groups.
   - Great power inevitably distorts the truth. Power is all about changing reality rather than seeing it for what it is.
   - The problem is that it has become extremely complicated to grasp what we are actually doing. Most of the injustices in the contemporary world results from large-scale structural biases rather than from individual prejudices, and our hunter-gather brains did not evolve to detect structural biases. In trying to comprehend and judge the moral dilemmas of this scale people often resort to one of four methods: Downsize the issue / Focus on a touching human story that ostensibly stands for the whole conflict / weave conspiracy theories (These three methods try to deny the true complexity of the world) / The 4th and ultimate method is to create dogma, put our trust is some allegedly all-knowing theory, institution, or chief, and follow it wherever it leads us.
   - Even if you start with a rejection of all religious dogma and with a firm commitment to scientific truth, sooner or later the complexity of reality becomes so vexing that you might be driven to fashion a doctrine that shouldn't be questioned.
   - When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that's fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that's a religion. For better or worse, fiction is one of the most effective tools in humanities tool kit.
   - The Roman Senate claimed to have the power to turn people into gods.
   - If you want to gauge group loyalty, requiring people to believe and absurdity is a far better test than asking them to believe the truth.
   - Truth and power can travel together only so far. IF you want power, at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power. You will have to admit things -- for example, about the sources of your own power -- that will anger allies, dishearten followers, or undermine social harmony.
   - As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it.
   - One of the great fictions of all is to deny the complexity of the world and think in absolute terms: pristine purity versus satanic evil
   - We cannot investigate everything ourselves. But precisely because of that, we need to at least carefully investigate our favorite sources of information. If you want reliable information, pay good money for it. If you get your news for free, you might well be the product.
   - In the 21st century, science fiction might be the most important genre of all.
   - In truth, everything you will ever experience in life is within your own body and your own mind.
   - Huxley's genius consists in showing that you can control people far more securely through love and pleasure than through fear and violence.
   - Our old stories are crumbling, and no new story has so far emerged to replace them.
   - The last thing a teacher needs to give her pupils is more information. They already have far too much of it. Instead, people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and above all to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world.
   - For thousands of years philosophers and prophets have urged people to know themselves. This advice was never more urgent than in the 21st century, now we have serious competition. We are living in the era of hacking humans.
   - To give meaning to my life a story needs to satisfy just two conditions: First, it must give me some role to play. Second, it must extend beyond my horizons.
   - "This is the body!" in Latin "Hoc est corpus!" got garbled into "Hocus pocus!"
   - If by "free will" you mean the freedom to do what you desire, then yes, humans have free will. But if by "free will" you mean the freedom to choose what to desire, then no, humans have no free will.
   - As long as you strongly identify with whatever thoughts and desires pop up in your mind, you dont need to make much effort to know yourself. You think you already know exactly who you are. But once you realize "Hey these thoughts aren't me. They are just biochemical vibrations!" then you also realize you have no idea who -- or what -- you are.
   - The Buddha taught that the three basic realities of the universe are that everything is constantly changing, nothing has any enduring essence, and nothing is completely satisfying. Suffering emerges because people fail to appreciate this.
   - According to the Buddha, then, life has no meaning, and people dont need to create any meaning. They just need to realize that there is no meaning, and therefore be liberated from the suffering caused by our attachments and our identification with empty phenomena.
   - The big question facing humans isn't "What is the meaning of life?" but rather "how do we stop suffering?"
   - The academic world provided me with powerful tools with which to deconstruct all the myths humans ever created, but it did not offer satisfying answers to the big questions of life. On the contrary, it encouraged me to focus on narrower and narrower questions.
   - What is there that endures from birth to death ? The more closely you observe yourself, the more obvious it becomes that nothing endures even from one moment to the next.
   - Suffering is not an objective condition in the outside world. It is a mental reaction generated by my own mind.
   - Meditation is any direct observation of ones own mind.



# A world without email (Cal Newport)
   - Fantastic!  (Changed my life for the better)
   - A widely accepted premise of the modern knowledge work is that email saved us.
   - What if email didn't save us, but instead accidentally traded minor convinces for a major drag on real productivity, leading to slower economic growth over the last few decades?
   - Deep work argues that the knowledge sector is undervaluing concentration. While the ability to rapidly communicate using digital messages is useful, the frequent disruptions also make it hard to focus, which has a major impact on our ability to produce value output.
   - Constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work. it has instead become totally intertwined with how work gets done.
   - As email spread in the 80s and 90s it introduced something novel: low-friction communication at scale.
   - We didn't just shift our existing volume of voicemails, faxes, and memos to email. We completely transformed the underlying workflow that determines how our daily efforts unfold.
   - There is a massive productivity currently latent in the knowledge sector. To unlock it will require much more systematic thinking about how best to organize.
   - The future of work is increasingly cognitive. This means that the sooner we take seriously how human brains actually function, the sooner we'll realize that the hyperactive hive mind is a disastrously ineffective way to organize our efforts.
   - Knowledge work does not yet have its Henry Ford, but workflow innovations with impact on the same scale as the assembly line are inevitable.
   - Our brains do not parallel process information.
   - "I worry that ill face my death and realize that y life got lost in this frantic flotsam of daily stuff."
   - Study of the Stirrup: example of a technology introduced for a simple reason (to make riding horses easier) leading to vast and complicated consequences never imagined by its inventors (the rise of medieval feudalism).
   - Computer scientists investigating asynchronous communications discovered that spreading out communication with unpredictable delays introduced tricky new complexities.
   - Since 1900 the productivity of manual labor increased by a factor of 50. The push to make knowledge work more efficient will be the central challenge of our times.
   - The attention capital principle: the productivity of the knowledge sector can be significantly increased if we identify workflows that better optimize the human brains ability to sustain-ably add value to information.
   - Build structures around autonomy
   - Workflows should not be left to individuals to figure out on their own, as the most effective systems are unlikely to arise naturally.
   - Minimize mid-task context switching and minimize the sense of communication overload.
   - In knowledge work, "Innovation" applies to the products we produce, but not the means by which we produce them.
   - Good is not the same as easy, fulfilling is not the same as convenient.
   - The process principle: introducing smart production processes to knowledge work can dramatically increase performance and make the work much less draining.
   - Maintain a board for every major role in your professional life.
   - You need set times each week to review and update your personal board
   - Put your solo review meetings on your calendar and protect them like any other meeting or appointment.
   - "You should spend 30x the amount of time training someone to do a task than it would take you to do the task yourself one time"
   - By adding complexity to the rules we use to structure our communication, the actual amount of information required by the interactions can be reduced (ala Shannon).
   - Central idea in Shannon's information theory: clever protocols that take into account the structure of the information being communicated can perform MUCH better than naive approaches.
   - Anyone whose job requires more than one or two scheduled events in a typical week should be using a scheduling service
   - Why are the recipients in email addresses almost always people, and not, for example, departments, projects, or activities.
   - When you eliminate support staff, the skilled professionals become less intellectually specialized, as they have to spend more time on administrative work that computers made just easy enough for them to handle on their own
   - The specialization principle: In the knowledge sector, working on fewer things, but doing teach thing with more equality and accountability, can be the foundation for significantly more productivity.
   - there are few things more valuable than someone who consistently produces valuable output, and few approaches to work more satisfying than being given the room to focus on things that really matter.
   - Technological change is not additive; it is ecological.  A new medium does not add something; it changes everything. In the year 1500, after the printing press was invented, you did not have old Europe plus the printing press. You had a different Europe.
   - Knowledge worker productivity is the moonshot of the twenty first century.


# Homo Deus
  - Fantastic (as expected)
  - What is on humanities agenda today: For thousands of years the answer to this question remained unchanged. Famine, plague and war were always at the top of the list. Many thinkers and prophets concluded that famine, plague and war must be an integral part of Gods cosmic plan or of our imperfect nature. Yet at the dawn of the 3rd millennium, humanity wakes up to an amazing realization. Most people rarely think about it, but in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plague and war.
  - For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating to little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.
  - Humankind in the 21st century needs to ask itself an unprecedented question: what are we going to do with ourselves ? In a healthy, prosperous and harmonious world, what will demand our attention and ingenuity?
  - Mass famines still strike some areas from time to time, but they are exceptional, and they are almost always caused by human politics rather than natural catastrophes. There are no longer natural famines in the world; there are only political famines.
  - Just think what would have happen if AIDS would have erupted in 1581 rather than 1981... Nobody would have figured out what caused the epidemic, how it moved person to person, or or how it could be controlled. AIDS might have killed a much larger proportion of the human race, equaling or perhaps surpassing the Black Death.
  - There are good reasons to think that in the arms race between doctors and germs, doctors run faster.
  - It is likely that major epidemics will continue to endanger humankind in the future only if humankind itself creates them, in the serves of some ruthless ideology. The era when humankind stood helpless before natural epidemics is probably over: But we may come to miss it (BC the man-made versions are much worse).
  - In ancient agricultural societies human violence caused about 15% of all deaths, during the twentieth century violence caused only 5% of deaths, and in the early twenty-first century it is responsible for about 1%.
  - Sugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.
  - Previous generations though about peace as the temporary absence of war. Today we think about peace as the implausibility of war.
  - Despite all the talk of pollution, global warming and climate change, most countries have yet to make any serious economic or political sacrifices to improve the situation. When the moment comes to choose between economic growth and ecological stability, politicians, CEOs and voters almost prefer growth.
  - The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.
  - Having secured unprecedented levels of prosperity, health and harmony, and given our past record and current values, humanity's next targets are likely to be immortality, happiness and divinity.
  - In the 21C humans are likely to make ea serious bid for immortality.
  - Throughout history, religions and ideologies did not sanctify life itself. They always sanctified something above or beyond earthly existence, and were consequently quite tolerant of death.
  - Humans always die due to some technical glitch.
  - "There are three main modes of approaching death: You can accept it, deny it or you can fight it. I think our society is dominated by people who are into denial or acceptance, and I prefer to fight it" Peter Theil.
  - Its not easy to live knowing that you are going to die, but it is even harder to believe in immortality and be proven wrong.
  - In truth, so far modern medicine hasn't extended our natural lifespan by a single year. Its great achievement has been to save us from premature death.
  - Epicurus explained that worshiping gods is a waste of time, that there is no existence after death, and that happiness is the sole purpose of life. Most people in ancient times rejected Epicurean-ism, but today it has become the default view.
  - When Epicurus defined happiness as the supreme good, he warned his disciples that it is hard work to be happy. Material achievements alone will not satisfy us for long. Indeed, the blind pursuit of money, fame and pleasure will only make us miserable. Epicurus recommended, for example, to eat and drink in moderation and to curb ones sexual appetites. In the long run, a deep friendship will make us more content that a frenzied orgy.
  - The glass ceiling of happiness is held in place by two stout pillars, one psychological, the other biological. On the psychological level, happiness depends on expectations rather than objective conditions. We dont become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied with reality matches our expectations.
  - On the biological level, both our expectations and our happiness are determined by our biochemistry, rather than our economic, social or political situation.
  - A thousand things may make us angry, but anger is never an abstraction. It is always felt as a sensation of heat and tension in the body, which is what makes anger so infuriating.
  - People have be quarreling about education methods for thousands of years. Yet, hitherto everybody still agreed on one thing: in order to improve education, we need to change the schools. Today, for the first time in history, at least some people think it would be more efficient to change the pupils' biochemistry.
  - The state hopes to manipulate the biochemical pursuit of happiness, separating "bad" manipulations from "good" ones. The principle is clear: biochemical manipulations that strengthen political stability, social order and economic growth are allowed and even encouraged. Manipulations that threaten stability and growth are bad.
  - Epicurus warned his disciples that immoderate pursuit of pleasure is likely to make them miserable rather than happy. Buddha had made an even more radical claim, teaching that the pursuit of pleasant sensations is in fact the very root of suffering. Such sensations are just ephemeral and meaningless vibrations. Even when we experience them we dont react to them with contentment: rather, we just crave more. No matter how many blissful or exciting sensations I experience, they will never satisfy me.
  - If I identify happiness with fleeting pleasant sensations, and crave to experience more and more of them, I have no choice but to pursue them constantly. When I finally get them, they quickly disappear, and because the mere memory of past pleasures will not satisfy me, I have to start all over again. Even if I continue this pursuit for decades, it will never bring me any lasting achievement; on the contrary, the more I crave these pleasant sensations, the more stressed and dissatisfied I become. To attain real happiness, humans need to slow down the pursuit of pleasant sensations, not accelerate it.
  - The Buddhist view of happiness has a lot in common with the biochemical view. The Buddha's suggestion was to reduce our craving for pleasant sensations, and not allow them to control our lives. According to the Buddha, we can train our minds to observe how all sensations constantly arise and pass away.  When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are -- ephemeral and meaningless vibrations -- we loose interest in pursing them.
  - Relatively small changes in genes, hormones and neurons where enough to transform Homo Erectus -- who could produce nothing more than flint knives -- into Homo sapiens, who produce spaceships and computers.
  - We may well think of the new human agenda as consisting really of only one project (with any branches): attaining divinity.
  - Throughout history most gods were believed to enjoy not omnipotence but rather specific super-abilities such as the ability to design and create living beings to transform their own bodies; to control the environment and the weather; to read minds and to communicate at a distance; to travel at very high speeds; and of course to escape death and live indefinitely.  Humans are in the business of acquiring all these abilities, and then some. The average person now moves and communicates across distances much more easily than the Greek, Hindu, or African gods of old.
  - It is far from clear that we should be aiming at immortality, bliss and divinity. Adopting these particular projects might be a big mistake. But history is full of big mistakes. Given our past record and current values, we are likely to reach out for bliss, divinity and immortality -- even if it kills us.
  - Some complex systems are oblivious to our predictions. The process of human development, in contrast, reacts to them. The better our forecasts, the more reactions they engender. Hence paradoxically, as we accumulate more data and increase our computing power, event become wilder and more unexpected. The more we know the less we can predict.
  - The paradox of historical knowledge. Knowledge that does not change behavior is useless. But knowledge that changes behavior quickly loses relevance. Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a leisurely pace too. (In 1016 it was relatively easy to predict ow Europe would look in 1050, In contrast we have no idea how Europe will look in 2050).
  - If history doesn't follow any stable rules, why study it ? Historians are asked to examine the actions of our ancestors so that we can repeat their wise decisions and avoid their mistakes. But it almost never works like that because the present is just too different from the past. Science is not just about predicting the future. Scholars in all fields often seek to broaden our horizons. The study of history aims above all to make us aware of possibilities we dont normally consider. Historians study the past not in order to repeat it, but in order to be liberated from it.
  - Studying history aims to loosen the grip of the past. By observing the accidental chain of events that led us here, we realize how our very thoughts and dreams took shape -- and we can begin to think and dream differently. Studying history will not tell us what to choose, but at least it gives us more options.
  - The idea of nurturing a lawn at the entrance to private residences and public buildings was born in the castles of French and English aristocrats in the late Middle Ages. In the early modern age this habit struck deep roots, and became the trademark of nobility. Well-kept lawns demanded land and a lot of work, in exchange they produced nothing. Poor peasants could not afford wasting precious land or time on lawns. The neat turf at the entrance to a chateaux was accordingly a status symbol nobody could fake. (Proof of work).
  - Predicting that humankind will try to gain immortality, bliss and divinity is much like predicting that people building a house will want a lawn in their front yard. It sounds very likely. But once you say it out loud you begin to think about alternatives.
  - For 300 years the world has been dominated by humanism, which sanctifies the life, happiness and power of homo sapiens. The attempt to gain immortality, bliss and divinity merely takes the long-standing humanist ideals to their logical conclusions.
  - The rise of humanism also contains the seeds of its downfall. While the attempt to upgrade humans into gods takes humanism to its logically conclusion, it simultaneously exposes humanism's inherent flaws. If you start with a flawed ideal, you often appreciate its defects only when the ideal is close to realization.
  - Computers powerful enough to understand and overcome the mechanisms of aging and death will probably also be powerful enough to replace humans in any and all tasks.
  - At present it may seem that immortality, bliss and divinity occupy the top slots on our agenda. But once we come nearer to achieving these goals the resulting upheavals are likely to deflect us towards entirely different destinations.  The future described above is merely the future of the past -- ie a future based on the ideas and hopes that dominated the world for the last 300 years. The real future -- ie a future born of the new ideas and hopes of the 21C -- might be completely different.
  - Homo Sapiens does its best to forget the fact, but it is an animal. And it is doubly important to remember our origins at a time when we seek to turn ourselves into gods. The relationship between humans and animals is the best model we have for the future relations between super-humans and humans.
  - Humanism has dominated the world for 300 years, which is not such a long time. The pharaohs ruled Egypt for 3000 years, and the popes dominated Europe for a millennium.
  - With regards to other animals humans have long since become gods.
  - Humankind is poised to replace natural selection with intelligent design, and to extend life form the organic realm into the inorganic.
  - "Algorithm" is arguably the single most important concept in our world. Humans are algorithms that produce copies of themselves. The algorithms controlling humans work through sensations, emotions, and thoughts.
  - Not long ago psychologists doubted the importance of the emotional bond between parents and children even among humans. Childcare experts warned that children who were hugged and kissed by their parents would grow up to be needy, egotistical and insecure adults.
  - We normally think that theist religions sanctify the great gods. We tend to forget that they sanctified humans too. Hitherto Homo sapiens had been just one actor in a cast of thousands. In the new theist drama Sapiens became the central hero around whom the entire universe revolved.  The gods meanwhile where given two related roles to play. Firstly, they explained what is so special about sapiens and why humans should dominate and exploit all other organisms. Secondly, the gods had to mediate3 between humans and the ecosystem.
  - The agriculture revolution was both an economic and religious revolution.
  - During the agriculture revolution humankind silenced animals and plants, and turned the animist grand opera into a dialogue between man and gods. During the Scientific Revolution humankind silenced the gods too. The world was now a one man show. Humankind stood alone on an empty stage, talking to itself, negotiating with no one and acquiring enormous powers without any obligations.
  - The stream of consciousness is the concrete reality we directly witness every moment. It is the surest thing in the world. You cannot doubt its existence.
  - Every subjective experience has two fundamental characteristics: sensation and desire.
  - Scientists dont know how a collection of electrical brain signals creates subjective experiences. Even more crucially, they dont know what could be the evolutionary benefit of such a phenomenon. Ironically the better we map the brain, the harder it becomes to explain conscious feelings, the more redundant the mind seems. IF the entire system works by passing electrical signals from here to there, why the hell do we also need to feel fear ?
  - If we cannot explain the mind and if we dont know what function it fulfills, why not just discard it?
  - Everything a human does -- including reporting on allegedly conscious states -- might in theory be the work of non-conscious algorithms.
  - If cooperation is the key, how come the ants and bees did not beat us to the nuclear bomb even though they learned to cooperate en mass millions of years before us? Because their cooperation lacks flexibility.
  - The Russian revolution finally erupted now when 180 million peasants rose against the Tsar, but rather when a handful of communist placed themselves at the right place at the right time.
  - A nation of 100 million people functions in a fundamentally different way to a band of a hundred individuals.
  - Sapiens dont behave according to a cold mathematical logic, but rather according to a warm social logic. We refuse unfair offers b/c people who meekly accepted unfair offers didn't survive the Stone Age.
  - Most human kingdoms and empires where extremely unequal, yet man of them where surprisingly stable and efficient.
  - People constantly reinforce each others beliefs in a self-perpetuating loop. Each round of mutual confirmation tightens the web of meaning further, until you have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes. Yet over decades and centuries the web of meaning unravels and a new web is spun in its place. To study history means to watch the spinning and unraveling of these webs, and to realize that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants.
  - During the last 70000 years the intersubjective realities that Sapiens invented became ever more powerful, so that today they dominate the world. Will the chimpanzees, the elephants, the Amazon rain forests and the Artic glaciers survive the twenty-first century?  This depends on the wishes and decisions of intersubjective entities such as the European Union and the World Bank; entities that exist only in our shared imagination.
  - Historians seek to understand the development of inter-subjective entities like gods and nations, whereas biologists hardly recognize the existence of such things. To think historically means to ascribe real power to the contents of our imaginary stories.
  - North Korea and South Korea are so different from one another not because of the people or the climate. Its because the North is dominated by very different fictions.
  - During the 21C the border between history and biology is likely to blur not because we will discover biological explanations for historical events, but rather because ideological fictions will rewrite DNA stands; political and economic interests will redesign the climate; and the geography of mountains and rivers will give way to cyberspace. As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the 21C fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection.
  - About 5000 years ago the Sumerians invented both money and writing. These Siamese twins - born to the same parents at the same time and in the sample place -- broke the data processing limitations of the human brain. Writing has enabled humans to organize entire societies in an algorithmic fashion.
  - Sousa Mendes, armed with little more than a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust.
  - Many of the difficulties faced by present-day Africans countries stem from the fact that their borders make little sense. When the  written fantasies of European bureaucracies encountered the African reality, reality was forced to surrender.
  - If you stick only to unalloyed reality, without mixing any fiction in with it, few people will follow you. If you used a time machine to send modern scientists to ancient Egypt, she would not be able to seize power by exposing the fictions of the local priests and lecturing the peasants on evolution, relativity and quantum physics. If you happen to think so, you are welcome to travel to present-day Afghanistan or Syria and try your luck.
  - Like a child thinking that his parents are fighting because of him, the monotheist is convinced that the Persians are fighting the Babylonians because of him.
  - Even though Herodotus and Thucydides understood reality much better that the authors of the bible, when the two world views collided, the Bible won by a knockout. No matter how mistaken the biblical worldview was, it provided a better basis for large-scale human cooperation. (Its ironic to have to swear to tell the truth on a book brimming with so many fictions, myths, and errors.)
  - History isn't a single narrative, but thousands of alternative narratives. Whenever we choose to tell one, we are also choosing to silence the others.
  - Human cooperative networks usually judge themselves by yardsticks of their own invention, and not surprisingly, they often give themselves high marks. When examining history of any human network, it is therefore advisable to stop from time to time and look at things from the perspective of some real entity. How do you know if an entity is real ? Very simple -- just ask yourself "Can it suffer?"
  - Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states, or corporations, no complex human society can function. But the stories are just tools. They should not become our goals or our yardsticks.
  - In the 21C, we will create more powerful fictions and more totalitarian religions than in any previous era.
  - It is often said that god helps those who help themselves. This is a roundabout way of saying that god doesn't exist, but if our belief in Him inspires us to do something ourselves -- it helps. In contract scientific theories are not just a way to bind people together. Antibiotics, unlike God, help even those who dont help themselves. They cure infections weather you believe in them or not.
  - Instead of destroying the intersubjective reality, science will enable it to control the objective and subjective realities more completely than before.
  - Religion is any all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms and values. It legitimizes human social structures by arguing that they reflect superhuman laws. Religion asserts that we humans are subject to a system of moral laws that we did not invent and that we cannot change. As far as we know, all human societies believe in this. Every society tells its members that they must obey some superhuman moral law, and that breaking this law will result in catastrophe.
  - Just as the gap between religion and science is narrower than we commonly think, so the gap between religion and spirituality is much wider. Religion is a deal, whereas spirituality is a journey.
  - In theory, both science and religion are interested above all in truth, and bb/c each upholds a different truth, they are doomed to clash. In fact neither science nor religion cares that much about truth, hence they can easily compromise, co-exit and cooperate. Religion is interested above all in order. In aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science is interested above all in power (questionable...).
  - Modern history can be thought of as the process of formulating a deal between science and one particular religion - namely, humanism. Modern society believes in humanists dogmas, and uses science not in order to question these dogmas, but rather in order to implement them. 
  - Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.  If modernity has a motto it is "shit happens". We are constrained by nothing except our own ignorance. No paradise awaits us after our death -- but we can create paradise here on earth and live in it forever, if we just manage to overcome some technical difficulties.
  - The modern deal offers us an enormous temptation, coupled with a colossal threat. Omnipotence is in front of us, almost within our reach, but below us yawns the abyss of complete nothingness.
  - Much of the credit for overcoming famine and plague belongs to the ardent capitalist faith in growth. Capitalism even deserves some kudos for reducing human violence and increasing tolerance and cooperation.
  - The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realized how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress.
  - Throughout history prophets and philosophers have argued that if humans stopped believing in a great cosmic plan, all law and order would vanish. Yet today, those who pose the greatest threat to global law and order are precisely those people who continue to believe in God and His all-encompassing plans.
  - The central religious revolution of modernity was not losing faith in God; rather, it was gaining faith in humanity.
  - (Exodus 20:4) God commanded us to not make any images of either humans or animals.
  - The highest aim of human life is to fully develop your knowledge through a wide variety of intellectual, emotional and physical experiences.  The aim of life's existence is "a distillation of the widest possible experience of life into wisdom".
  - "War is not what you see in movies!" warn Hollywood blockbusters such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Black-hawk Down.
  - Humanism split into three main branches. The orthodox branch holds that each human being is a unique individual possessing a distinctive inner voice and a never-to-be-repeated series of experiences.
    The other are socialist humanism, which encompassed a plethora of socialist and communist movements, and evolutionary humanism, whose most famous advocates were the Nazis.
  - You cannot resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict by having 8 million Israeli citizens and the 350 million citizens of Arab League nations vote on it. Democratic elections usually work only within populations that have some prior common bond, such as shared religious beliefs or national myths. They are a method to settle disagreements among people who already agree on the basics.
  - According to evolutionary humanists, everyone arguing that all human experiences are equally valuable is either an imbecile or a coward.
  - As humanism conquered the world, these internal schisms widened, and eventually they flared up into the deadliest religious war in history. Form 1914-1989 a murderous war of religion raged between the three humanist sects.
  - Liberal democracy was saved only by nuclear weapons.
  - More the a century after Nitchze pronounced him dead, God seems to be making a comeback. But this is a mirage. God is dead -- its just taking a while to get rid of the body.
  - Pope Pius lead a series of reforms in Catholic dogma and established the novel principle of papal infallibility, according to which the Pope can never err in matter of faith (this seemingly medieval idea became binding Catholic dogma only in 1870, 11 years after the publication of On the origin of Species.
  - The main product of the 21C will be bodies, brains and minds, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be far bigger than the gab between Dickens Britain and Mahdi's Sudan. In the 21C, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction.
  - Liberals value individual liberty so much because they believe that humans have free will.
  - The contradiction between free will and contemporary science is the elephant in the laboratory, whom many prefer not to see as they peer into their microscopes and fMRI scanners.
  - Over the last century, as scientist opened up the Sapiens black box, they discovered there neither soul, no free will, nor "self" -- but only genes.
  - To the best of our scientific understanding, determinism and randomness have divided the entire cake between them, leaving not even a crumb for "freedom". Free will exists only in the imaginary stories we humans have invented.  The last nail in freedoms coffin is provided by the theory of evolution. Just as evolution cannot be squared with eternal souls, neither can it swallow the idea of free will. For if humans are free, how could natural selection have shaped them?
  - Doubting free will is not just a philosophical exercise. It has practical implications. If organisms indeed lack free will, it implies that we can manipulate and even control their desires using drugs, genetic engineering or direct brain stimulation.
  - Science undermines not only the liberal belief in free will, but also the belief in individualism. For liberalism to make sense, I must have one - and only one - true self. Humans are individuals they are "dividuals".
  - At the beginning of the 3rd millennium liberalism is threatened not by the philosophical idea that "there are no free individuals", but rather by concrete technologies.
  - In the 21C three practical developments might make the belief that every human is a uniquely valuable individual obsolete:
      1) Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, hence the economic and political system will stop attaching value to them.
      2) The system will continue to find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals
      3) The system will still find value in some  unique individuals, but thesse will constitute a new elite of upgraaded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.
  - Liberalism did not become the dominant idealology because its philosophical arguments were the most valid. It succeeded b/c there was abundant political, economic and military sense in ascribing value to every human being. (Agrument agianst Anarchism)
  - In the 20C liberals explained that we dont have to choose between ethics and economics. Protecting human rights and liberties waas both a more imperative and theh key to economic growth. In the 21C liberalism will have a much harder time selling itself.
  - There might be severaal alternative ways leaading to super-intelligence, only some of which pass through the straits of consciousness.
  - This raises a novel question: which of the two is really important, intelligence or consciousness ? As long as they went hand in hand, debating thier relative value was just an amusing pastime for philosophers. But in the 21C this is becoming an urgent political and economic issue. For armies and corporations, the answer is straightforward: intelligence is mandatory but consciousness is optional.
  - We should remind ourselves of the fate of horses during the Industrial Revolution. An ordinary farm horse can small, love, recognize faces, jump over fences and do a thousand other things far better than a Model T or a Lamborghini. But cars nevertheless replaced horses b/c they were superior in the handful of tasks that the system really needed. Taxi drivers are likely to go the way of the horses.
  - The most important question in the 21C economics may will be what to do with all the superfluous people.
  - We might end up with an algorithmic upper class owning most of our planet. This may sound impossible, but before dismissing the idea, remember that most of our planet is already owned by non-human entities, namely nations and corporations. Indeed 5000 years ago, much of Sumer was owned by imaginary gods. If gods can possess land and employ people, why not algorithms ?
  - Traditionally life has been divided into two parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working. Very soon this traditional model will become utterly obsolete, and the only way for humans to stay in the game will be to keep learning throughout their lives.
  - Throughout history the rich have enjoyed many social and political advantages, but no huge biological gap ever separated them from the poor. In the future, however, we may see real gaps in physical and cognitive abilities opening between an upgraded upper class and the rest of society.
  - Medicine is undergoing a tremendous conceptual revolution. 20C medicine aimed to heal the sick. 21C medicine is increasingly aiming to upgrade the healthy.
  - The religions are unlikely to emerge from the caves of Afghanistan or the madrasas of the middle east. Rather, they will emerge form research laboratories. Silicon Valley is where hi-tech gurus are brewing for us brave new religions that have little to do with God, and everything to do with technology. They promise all the old prizes -- happiness, peace, prosperity and even eternal life -- but here on earth with the help of technology, rather than after death with the help of celestial beings. These new techno-religions can be divided into two main types: techno-humanism and data religion.
  - Data religion argues that humans have completed their cosmic task and should now pass the torch on to entirely new kinds of entities.
  - Techno-humanism, which still sees humans as the apex of creation and clings to many traditional humanist values. Techno-humanism agrees that Homo-Sapiens as we know it has run its historical course and will no longer be relevant in the future, but concludes that we should therefore use technology in order to create Homo Deus - a much superior human model.  Maybe 
  - Maybe a few additional changes to our genome and another rewiring of our brain will suffice to launch a second cognitive revolution.
  - Modern western culture is unique in lacking a specialized class of people who seek to experience extraordinary mental states.
  - Hunter-gathers are able to smell from a distance the difference between various animal species, various humans and even various emotions.
  - Though we have more choice than ever before, we have lost the ability to pay attention to whatever we choose.
  - From a historical perspective its clear that something momentous is happening. The number one humanist commandment -- listen to yourself! -- is no longer self-evident. Silencing annoying voices in my head seems like a wonderful idea, provided it enables me to finally hear my deep authentic self. But if there is no authentic self, how do I decide which voices to silence and which to amplify?
  - Techno-humanism faces an impossible dilemma here. It considers the human will to be the most important thing in the universe, hence it pushes humankind to develop technologies that can control and redesign the self at will. After all its tempting to gain control over the most important thing in the world. Yet should we ever achieve such control, techno-humanism would not know what to do with it, because the sacred human would then become just another designer product.
  - A bolder techno-religion seeks to sever the humanist umbilical cord altogether. If foresees a world that does not revolve around the desires and experiences of any human beings.
  - Experts see the economy as a mechanism for gathering data  about desire and abilities, and turning this data into decisions.
  - Data-processing considerations also explain why capitalists favor lower taxes. Heavy taxation mean that a large part of all available capital accumulates in one place -- the state coffers -- and consequently more and more decisions have to be made by a single processor, namely the government. This creates and overly centralized data processing system. In extreme cases, which taxes are exceedingly high, almost all capital ends up in the governments hands, and so the government alone calls the shots. In a free market, if one processor makes a wrong decision, others will be quick to capitalize on its mistake. However, when a single processor makes almost all the decisions, mistakes can be catastrophic.
  - In the 21C, democracy might decline and even disappear. As both the volume and speed of data increase, venerable institutions like elections, political parties, and parliaments might become obsolete -- bot because they are unethical, but because they cant process data efficiently enough.
  - The critical choices between alternative web designs weren't taken through a democratic political process, even though they involved traditional political issues such as sovereignty, borders, privacy and security.
  - The NSA may be spying on our every word, but to judge by the repeated failures of American foreign policy, nobody in Washington knows what to do with all the data.
  - Precisely because technology is now moving so fast, and parliaments and dictators alike are overwhelmed by data they cannot process quickly enough, present-day politicians are thinking on a far smaller scale than their predecessors a century ago. Consequently, in the early 21C, politics is bereft of grand visions.  Government has become mere administration. It manages the country, but no longer leads it. Government ensures that teachers are paid on time and sewage systems dont overflow, but it has no idea where the country will be in 20 years. To a certain extent, this is a very good thing. Given that some of the big political visions of the 20C led us to Auschwitz, Hiroshima, and the Great Leap forward. Many neo-liberal economists and political scientists argue that it is best to leave all the important decisions in the hands of the free market. They there by give politicians the perfect excuse for inaction and ignorance, which are reinterpreted as profound wisdom. Politicians find it convenient to believe that the reason they dont understand the world is that they dont need to understand it.
  - Dataism: Humans are merely tools for creating the Internet-of-All things, which may eventually spread out from planet earth to pervade the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This cosmic data-processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything, and humans are destined to merge into it. Dataism is the first movement since 1789 that created a genuinely novel value; freedom of information.
  - 50 Million communal autonomous cars could replace 1 billion private cars, and we would also need fewer roads, bridges, tunnels and parking spaces. Provided, of course, that I renounce my privacy and allow the algorithms always to know where I am and where I want to go.
  - Traditional religions assured you that your every word and action was part of some great cosmic plan, and that God watched you every minute and cared about your thoughts and feelings. Data religions now says that your every word and action is part of the great data flow, that the algorithms are constantly watching you and that they care about everything you do and feel.
  - Throughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new an simple answer. Humans can write poems and blogs about their experiences and post them online, thereby enriching the global data-processing system. That makes their bits count.
  - By equating the human experience with data patterns, Dataism undermines our primary source of authority and meaning and heralds a tremendous religious revolution, the like of which has not been seen since the 18C.  In the days of Locke, Hume and Voltaire humanist argued that "God is the product of the human imagination". Dataism now gives humanists a taste of their own medicine, and tells them: "Yes, God is a product of the human imagination, but human imagination in turn is just the product of biochemical algorithms." In the 18C, humanism sidelined God by shifting from a deo-centric to a homo-centric world view. In the 21C, Dataism may sideline humans by shifting from a homo-centric to a data-centric view.
  - The shift from a homo-centric to a data-centric view wont be merely a philosophical revolution. It will be a practical revolution. All truly important revolutions are practical. The humanists idea that "Humans invented God" was significant because it had far-reaching practical implications. Similarly, that Dataist idea that "organisms are algorithms" is significant due to its day-to-day practical consequences. Ideas change the world only when hey change our behavior
  - Our love, our fear and our passion aren't some nebulous spiritual phenomena good only for composing poetry. Rather, they encapsulate millions of years of practical wisdom. When you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm that evolution has developed for millions of years, and that withstood the harshest quality-control tests of natural selection. Your feelings are not infallible, of course, but they are better than most other sources of guidance.
  - Yet in the 21C feelings are no longer the best algorithms in the world. Consequently you should stop listening to your feelings and start listening to these external algorithms instead. Whats the point of having democratic elections when the algorithms know not only how each person is going to vote, but also the underlying neurological reasons why one person votes Democrat while another votes Republican?
  - Dataism will probably accelerate the humanist pursuit of heath, happiness and power. Yet once authority shifts from humans to algorithms, the humanist projects may become irrelevant.
  - Humans are relinquishing authority to the free market, to crowd wisdom and to external algorithms partly because we cannot deal with the deluge of data. In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the 21C censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.
  - If we think in terms of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. IF we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large. Yet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes
    1) Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms and life is data processing
    2) Intelligence is decoupling form consciousness
    3) Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.
  - These 3 processes raise 3 key questions:
    1) Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?
    2) Whats more valuable -- intelligence or consciousness ?
    3) What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?

# Super-freakonomics
  - In 1818 the world seemly reached point where largest cities could not survive without the horse, but couldnt survive with it either... And then the problem vanished. Solved by technological innovation. (Lesson for climate change?)
  - Given the financial crises, one wonders if macro economics is the domain of any economist.
  - Deliberate practice 3 key components: setting specific goals, obtaining immediate feedback, and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
  - Ambulances used to be run by local mortuary. Its hard to tin of a better example of misaligned incentives.
  - People who buy annuities live longer than people who dont. Annuities steady payout provides extra incentive to keep chugging along.
  - Ammonium nitrate (responsible for the population boom after the industrial revolution) an amazingly cheep and effective fertilizer. "Ammonium Nitrate feeds the world"
  - The movement to stop global warming has taken on the feel of a religion. The core belief that humankind inherited a pristine Eden, has sinned greatly by polluting it, and must now suffer lest we all perish in a fiery Apocalypse.
  - The problem with solar cells is that they are black. Need to be b/c they are designed to absorb light from the sun. One ~10% is turned into electricity, the rest is re-radiated as heat which contributes to global warming.
  - We've already engineered the earth. In a few centuries we have burned up most fossil fuel that took 3e8 years to make. Compared to that, injecting a bit of sulfur into the sky seems pretty mild. Sulfur isn't even the optimal chemical for stratospheric shield. Other materials Aluminum/plastics micro beads could be more efficient, but sulfur has proof of  principle with volcanoes.
  - After 911 the sudden absence of contrails accounted for a rise in ground temperature of 1 degree C.
  - IF you believe that the scary global warming stories could be true, that you should also admit that relying only on reducing Carbon emissions is that a very good answer. It is illogical to believe in a C-induced warming apocalypse and that such an apocalypse can be averted simply by curtailing new C-emissions. The scary scenarios could occur even if we reduce emissions to 0, only real answer is geoengineering.
  - Doctors should be forbidden to wear neckties. they are rarely laundered, perform no beneficial function in patient care, and have been show to be colonized by pathogens.


# Deep Work  (Cal Newport)
  - Fantastic!
  - Deepwork: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to the limit. These efforts create new value, improve skill and are hard to replicate.
  - Our work culture shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few that recognize the potential of resisting this trend.
  - The growing necessity of deep work is new. In an industrial economy most workers could do fine with out working without distraction. In the information economy, deep work is becoming a key currency. "Super power of the 21C"
  - "Deep work hypothesis" DW is becoming increasingly rare at the same time its becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
  - Core abilities for future: Be able to quickly master hard things. Be able to produce at an elite level. Both quality and speed.
  - If you dont produce you wont thrive, no matter how skilled or talented you are.
  - To learn hard things quickly you mush focus intensely without distraction.
  - When you switch tasks your attention doesn't immediately follow, there is a residual  that is stuck in the previous task.
  - Paradox: DW more valuable than ever before, yet not promoted by individuals or organizations.
  - Skillful management of attention is the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.
  - "Who you are, what you think, feel and do, what you love - is the sum of what you focus on"
  - A workday driven by the shallow is likely to be draining and upsetting even if they seem harmless or fun in the moment.
  - Most people assume that relaxation will make them happy. Our felling of going deep is in itself very rewarding.
  - In the post enlightenment world we have tasked ourselves to identify whats meaningful and whats not, an exercise that can seem arbitrary and induce nihilism.
  - The key to developing a DW habit is to add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the barrier to DW.
  - People who use their minds to create value are rarely haphazard in their work habits.
  - Focus on the WILDLY IMPORTANT: The more you try to do the less you actually accomplish.
  - Act on the leading measures: you need to measure your success: Lagging vs Leading measures. Leading measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control that will have positive impact on long-term goals.
  - Keep a compelling scoreboard: "People play differently when you keep score."
  - Create a cadence of accountability: Use weekly review / celebrate good weeks / understand bad weeks.
  - Shutdown at the end of work day: If need more time, extend workday. Downtime adds insights; unconscious mind well suited for complex tasks, integrating large amounts of information with multiple, vague and conflicting constraints.
  - The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not that important.
  - Decades of work from multiple subfields all point towards the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work.
  - If every potential moment of boredom is relieve with a glance at a smart phone, then your brain has been rewired to point where it is not ready for deep work.
  - Schedule in advance when you will use the internet, then avoid outside these times.
  - To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern times.
  - Put more thought into your leisure time.  Dedicate some advanced thinking to the question of how you want to spend your time "off".
  - Mental facilities are capable of continuous hard activity; they do not tire like a arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep.
  - Treat shallow work with suspicion. b/c its damage often vastly underestimated and its importance is vastly over estimated.
  - Stumbling on important insights are perfectly valid reasons to ignore schedules.
  - Time blocking is about thoughtfulness, not constraint. Simple habit that focuses you to continually take a moment throughout your day to ask "what makes sense for me to do?"   The habit of asking is what returns results.

# The Red Queen
   Need to write up notes from the notebook 3 Aug 2021
  - The concept that all progress is relative, is known as the "Red Queen" from a chess piece in Alice in wonderland that runs but never gets anywhere.
  - One of the great recurring themes in human history is the balance between cooperation and conflict.
  - The principle insight of the theory of sexual selection is that the goal of an animal is snot just to survive but to breed. Where the breeding and survival come into conflict, its breeding that takes precedence. And breeding in sexual species consists of finding an appropriate partner and convincing it to part with some of its genes. This goal is so central to life that it has influenced the design not only of the body but of the psyche.
  - The greatest "experts" our species has produced on the subject of human nature were people like Buddha and Shakespeare, not scientists or philosophers.
  - Why did sex evolve: Survey the scientists and virtually all will agree that the problem has been solved, but none will agree on the solution.
  - Selection within species is always going to be more important than selection between the species.
  - Scientist used to think of mutations as rare events. They are accumulated at a rate of about 100 / genome / generation in mammals. Your children will have 100 differences between you and your spouse.
  - Sex gives variety, so sex makes a few of your offspring exceptional and a few abysmal, whereas sex makes them all average.
  - There is no evidence yet found that any creature ever done anything other than try to keep its mutation rate as low as possible.
  - You might have a gene that is more like the gene of a certain cow than it is like the equivalent gene in your spouse.
  - The immune system is a fairly recent invention in geological terms. It started in reptiles perhaps 300 millions year ago.
  - Disease might almost put a sort of limit on longevity; There is little point in living much longer than it takes your parasites to adapt to you.
  - Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat form parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are woman's insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox.
  - At first sight the most foolish system of all is two sexes because it means that fully 50 percent of the people you meet are incompatible breeding partners.
  - Tragedy of the commons plagues the world of genes. It is oddly the reason that boys are different from girls.
  - A Son is a high-risk, high-reward reproductive option compared with a daughter. A mother in good condition gives her offspring a good start in life, increasing the chances of her sons winning harems as they mature. A mother in poor condition is likely to produce a feeble son who will fail to reproduce at all. whereas daughters can join harems and reproduce even when not in top condition. So you should have sons if you have reason to think they will do well and daughters if you have reason to think they will do poorly.
  - The ancient belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputated.
  - The sex that invests more in rearing the young  is the sex that makes the least profit from extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates.
  - Every behavior is the product of an instinct trained by experience.
  - For a man, women are vehicles that can carry his genes into the next generation. For a woman, men are sources of vital substance (sperm) that can turn their eggs into embryos. For each gender the other is a sough-after resource to be exploited.
  - Humans are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.
  - The basic asymmetry between the genders goes right back to the difference in size of a sperm and an egg. Women cannot increase their fecundity by taking more mates; man can.
  - Where males invest more time or energy in the care of the young, females take the initiative in courtship, and vice versa.
  - People cannot be adapted to the present or the future; they can only be adapted to the past.
  - In the past... they probably lived in small bands; they were perhaps nomadic; they ate both meat and vegetable; they presumably shared the features that are universal among modern humans of all cultures: a pair bond as an institution in which to rear children, romantic love, jealousy and sexually induced male-male violence, a female preference for men of high status, a mail preference for young females, warfare between bands, and so on. There was almost certainly a sexual division of labor between hunting men and gathering women, something unique to people and a few birds of prey. Everybody know or had heard of nearly all the people they were likely to meet in their lives: There were no strangers, a fact that had enormous importance for the history of trade and crime prevention. The lack of anonymity meant that charlatans and tricksters could rarely get away with their deceptions for long.
  - With the invention of agriculture, the opportunity for some males to be polygamous arrived with a vengeance.
  - It is noteworthy that it is hard to distinguish between wealth and power before the time of the Renaissance.
  - The amount of sperm that is retained in a women's vagina after sex varies according to whether she had an orgasm and when. It also depends on how long it was since she last had sex.
  - The sexual division of labor, the institution of child-rearing marriages, and the invention of language -- three of the most fundamental human characteristics shared with no other ape -- all depend on another.
  - Throughout the animal kingdom the day of ovulation is announced with fanfare. But not in man. A tiny change in a women temperature, undetectable before thermometers, and that is all. Women' genes seem to have gone to inordinate lengths to conceal the moment of ovulation.
  - Both men and women have intercourse whenever they feel like it, without reference to hormonal events. Compared with many animals, we are astonishingly hooked on copulation.
  - The noble savage, fare from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold. Little wonder that human sex is first and foremost in all societies a private thing to be indulged in only in secret.
  - People are strangely more apt to say of a baby, "He (or she) looks just like his father" than his mother. and that it is the mothers relative who are most likely to say this.
  - Mankind may be the mammal with the greatest division of sexual labor and the greatest of mental differences between the sexes.
  - Contradiction at the heat of feminism: You cannot say first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs, and second that if jobs were done by women they would be done differently.
  - Not that racial and cultural differences cannot exist. Just as a white man has different skin color from a black man, so it is quite possible that he also has a somewhat different mind. But given what we know of evolution, it is not very likely. The evolutionary pressures that have shaped the human mind - principally competitive relations  with kin members, tribal allies, and sexual partners -- are and have been the same for white and black men and were at work before the ancestors of whites left Africa 1e5 years ago.
  - The male preference for skinniness seems positively maladaptive.
  - The male obsession with youth is characteristically human. There is no other animal yet studied that shares this obsession quite as strongly. This is obviously because of the human habits of lifelong marriage and long, slow periods of child rearing are also unique.
  - "Coolidge effect" Calvin Cooldige and his wife where being shown around a farm. Learning that a cockerel could have sex dozens of times a day, Mrs Coolidge said: "Pleas tell that to this president". On being told, Mr Coolidge asked, "Same hen every time?" "Oh, no, Mr President. A different one each time" The president continued: "Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge"
  - The depressing part of Darwin's insight is that it shows how beauty cannot exist without ugliness. Sexual selection, Red Queen-style, in inevitably a cause of dissatisfaction, vain striving, and misery to individuals. (See the Buddha)
  - What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed ?  And why did it happen to one ape and not another ? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. The evolution of mans big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.
  - Almost all linguists agree with Noam Chomsky that there is a "deep structure" that is universal to all languages and that is programmed into th e brain rather than learned.
  - Philosophers assume that intelligence and consciousness have obvious advantages and get on with the serious debate about what consciousness is. Before the 1970s there was very little evidence that any of them had even posed the obvious evolutionary question: Why is intelligence a good thing ?
  - The things of which we are conscious are mostly the mental events that concern social actions. Consciousness operates on a "need to know" policy.
  - No conversation between people who know each other well ever lingers for long on any topic other than the behavior, ambitions, motives, frailties and affairs of other members of the group.
  - The human mind may not be much suited to logic at all, but it is well suited to judging the fairness of social bargains and the sincerity of social offers.
  - The neocortex is largely a courtship device to attract and retain sexual mates: Its specific evolutionary function is to stimulate and entertain other people, and to assess the stimulation attempts of others.
  - Wherever else in the animal kingdom we find greatly exaggerated and enlarged ornaments, we have been able to explain them by the runaway, sexy-son, Fisher effect of intense sexual selection. It seems perverse not to consider it when trying to explain the exponential expansion of the brain.
  - Dance, music, humor, and sexual foreplay are all features unique to human beings.
  - We are as domesticated as any dog or cow, perhaps more so. We have bred out of ourselves all sorts of instincts that were probably features of our Pleistocene nature.
