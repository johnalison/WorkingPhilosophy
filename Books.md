**2020**

# Thinking about Mathematics (Stewart Shapiro)
  - Very good. Not actionable, but very interesting.
  - Come down with Structuralism
  - Classical logic and impredicative definitions are thoroughly entrenched in contemporary mathematics. Accepted not b/c sanction philosophically, but b/c smooth practice of math needs them.
  - Lowenheim-Skolem Theorems: Notions of natural number finitude, ect. cannot be captured in 1st order theories. Any 1st order theory, if it has infinite models, has unintended models that get these notions wrong.
  - Virtually all of math can be rendered in the language of set-theory, and all known theorems in math can be proved in ZFC (a version of set theory). However many interesting and important questions cannot be decided by ZFC axioms. eg: Cantors Continuum Hypothesis
  - Incompleteness theorem: Realist says it shows there is no axiomatization whose theorems are all and only the truths of arithmetic.
    "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system"
    Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability
  - The incompleteness theorem shows that the undecidable sentence phi is truth of the natural numbers => we have an informal proof of the truth of the formally undecidable sentence. There is more to arithmetic provability than can be derived in any fixed formal axiomatization. => arithmetic truth and informal arithmetic provability both out run what can be produced by a machine.
  - Kant took philosophical measure of the new scientific 19th C developments. The result was a heroic attempt to explain the necessity of math and the apriori nature of mathematical truths, while explaining the place of math in the empirical sciences.
  - Kant claimed: Structure of mathematical reasoning due to the structure of our apparatus of perception.
  - Widely agreed that Kants philosophy of math failed from later developments in math and science eg: non-euclidean Geometry.
  - Frege committed to view that all propositions about numbers are knowable. (T or F)
  - More Incompleteness: Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove.
  - Most real numbers do not have names.
  - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency (More incompleteness)
  - How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
  - Structuralism: The essence of a natural number is its relation  to other numbers. The subject matter of arithmetic is a single abstract structure. Set theorist point out that the set theoretic hierarchy contains as many isomorphissms types as possible. that is the point of the theory.

# The Denial of Death (Earnest Becker)
  - Interesting found it too speculative in places.
  - Seemed to be speaking to very specific field in places (eg: why do I /should I care what Freud was like as a person?)
  - Places great faith (with out justification) in psychoanalysis.
  - The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles would be over. Now we are choking in truth.
  - Knowledge is in a state of useless overproduction. Insignificant fragments are magnified out of proportion, while major and historical insights lie around begging for attention.
  - The experts give us manageable thrills -- if they thrill us at all.
  - Narcissism is what keeps men marching into  point blank cannon fire in wars.
  - Civilized society is a hopeful belief and protest that science and and goods "make men count" for mare than any other animal. In this sense, everything that man does is religious and heroic and yet in danger of being fictitious and fallible.
  - The crisis of modern society is that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that culture has set up
  - Children have no knowledge of death until 3-5
  - From the child of 5 to myself is but a step, but from the newborn baby to the child of 5 is an appalling distance.
  - Nothing like the essence of man has been found.
  - Mans self-consciousness makes man a small god in nature, yet at the same time man is a worm and food for worms. This duality is a painful contradiction. Lower animal spared this contradiction. (Q: Are we spared other painful contradictions from our limited knowledge/being ?
  - We are gods with anuses
  - The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body.
  - Most people tranquilize themselves in the trivial.
  - Man has an inner symbolic self which signifies certain freedom, but he is bound by a finite body which limits that freedom.
  - The self must be destroyed, brought down to nothing, in order for self-transcendence to begin. Then the self can begin to relate to powers beyond itself.
  - Man is the only organism in nature fated to puzzle out what it actually means to feel "right"
  - The most remarkable achievement in the Christian world picture: anyone can be a secure hero simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things: heaven.
  - Nature conquers death not by creating eternal organisms but by making it possible for ephemeral ones to procreate.
  - As soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffing at eternal problems like life and death... he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just as society maps these problems out for them.
  - All throughout history it is the "normal, average men" who, like locusts, have laid waste to the world in order to forget themselves.
  - Salpetrice mental hospital got cleared out at the time of the French Revolution. All the neurotics found a ready-made donor of self-transcending action and heroic identity.
  - The promise of Psychology was that it would usher in the era of happiness of man, by showing him how things worked, how one things causes another. Then all man had to do was take possession of these and his happiness would be assured.
  - All the analysis in the world doesn't allow a person to find out "who he is" or why he is here on earth, why he has to die, how he should live. It is when psychology pretends to do this (when it pretends to offer itself as full explanation for human unhappiness) that it becomes a fraud.
  - Religion is "just as good a psychology" as the psychology that pretended to replace it.
  - Modern man needs someone to turn to for spiritual dependence, as God is unfashionable in steps the therapist.
  - Claim: after the most exhaustive psychology quest, psychology gives way to theology
  - (DFW echos)  It is one thing to image this (theological) cure, but it is quite another thing to "prescribe" it to modern man. How hollow it must ring in his ears.
  - Freud: All cultural devices are self-hypnotic contrivances - from cars to moon rockets - ways that a surely limited animal can fascinate himself in an attempt to transcend reality.
  - The most one can achieve is a certain relaxedness an openness to experience that makes him less of a driven burden on others.
  - When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness.
  - The closing pages of this book are a realistic and regretful admission that the ego has to spread itself beyond the pleasures of the body in order for men to be men.

# Mysticism and Logic (Bertrand Russel)
  - essays where hit or miss.
  - Philosophers have felt the need of both science and mysticism. Attempts to harmonize the two make philosophy (for some) greater than science or religion.
  - Plato's Cave: statement of belief in knowledge and reality truer than our senses
  - Mysticism is to be commended as an attitude toward life, not as a creed about the world.
  - Insight, untested and unsupported is an insufficient guarantee of truth.
  - Instinct is least likely to err in practical matters which aid in survival.
  - Some distrust intellect in favor of instincts adapted for survival. Response:  It is only through the intellect that we know of the struggle for survival and the evolution of man.
  - Those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distortion of their own desires.
  - Scientific philosophy comes nearer to objectivity than any other human pursuit. It gives us the closest constant and most intimate relation with the outer world that is possible.
  - Our whole life if built of a number of primary instincts and impulses. Only that which is in some way connected with these (instincts and impulses) appear to us desirable or important. There is nothing (call it "reason" or "virtue") that can be outside these first movers
  - All meaning must be related to our prime desires.
  - The mere fact of living is not to be desired, but the art of living in contemplation of great things.
  - The solution of the difficulties which formerly surrounded the mathematical infinite is probably the greatest achievement of our age.
  - G Cantor has solved Zeno's paradoxes, turns out that its not true that if you take something away from a collection it always gets smaller. The recognition of this fact removes the difficulties and make an exact science of the infinite.
  - Pure math was discovered by Boole "Laws of thought" 1854
  - Math can be defined as the subject in which we never know what we're talking about, nor weather what we are saying is true.
  - Obviousness is always the enemy of correctness.
  - The whole of arithmetic and algebra has been shown to require 3 indefinable notions and 5 indemonstrable propositions.
  - Most numbers are infinite. Infinitely many more infinite numbers.
  - Philosophy is the science of the possible.
  - You cannot alter the past, but you can also not make the future other than it will be.
  - Obviously you can have no effect on the past. But this does not mean that the past would not have been different if our present wishes had been different. Our present wishes are conditioned by the past and therefore could not be different unless the past was different. The past cannot be different from what it was , but no more can our present wishes be different from what they are.
  - Its hard to discover any state of mind which I am aware of myself alone, as opposed to a complex of which I am a constituent.

# Beyond Good and Evil
  - Wasn't doing it for me (Bailed halfway through)
  - Could tell (got the feeling) that it was interesting to the cognoscenti
  - But too much over my head.
  - "Christianity is Platonism for the people"
  - Critique of " I think therefore I am" a thought comes when it wants, not when I want it to.
  - It is not the worst things of which one is most ashamed.
  - He who attains his ideal by that very fact transcends it.
  - There are no moral phenomena, only moral interpretations of phenomena
  - To make someone interested in you: pretend to be embarrassed in their presence.
  - The will to overcome an emotion is ultimately the will of another emotion.
  - He who fights monsters should be careful he doesn't become one. When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss gazes into you.
  - Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, peoples it is the norm.
  - Ultimately one loves ones desires and not that which is desired.

# 40 Ways to view Churchill
  - Good book, just not getting that much from it. (Bailed halfway through)
  - Interesting take on Biography: presenting both/all sides of person
  - How little we can know anyone, and how impossible is the task of summing up.
  - Churchill ignited a monetary crisis when he returned Britain to the gold standard in 1925.
  - Churchill was vehemently opposed to Indian independence.
  - "I would rather by right than consistent"s

# Bullet Journal Method
  - Very good idea
  - Like the idea of documenting my life
  - From nurse at a hospice center: The number one regret was that people wished they had stayed true to themselves
  - View BuJo as a living autobiography
  - Can track the decisions you've made, the actions that led you to where you are now. Can learn from experiences.
  - The long way is the short way.
  - True efficiency is not about speed, its about spending more time with what truly matters.
  - Our memories are unreliable.
  - The more content you try to capture during a meeting the less your thinking about whats being said. You burn through most of you attention trying to parrot the source.
  - (re: meetings) Sit for a while and give yourself a moment to process what you heard
  - When making notes: keep your future self in mind.
  - For everything you say yes to, your saying no to something else. Yes means work, sacrifice, time, and opportunity cost.
  - Organization can become a cleverly disguised form of distraction.
  - "It is not daily increase, but daily decrease. Hack away the inessential" Bruce Lee
  - (re: social media) "Exploiting vulnerability in human psychology is the bread and butter of our economy" -founding member of facebook
  - Endurance often proves to be the most cunning and lethal adversary.
  - If your goal in life is to be useful to others, start by figuring out how to be useful to yourself.
  - Add notes about social engagements: have fun ? What did you learn ? How did you feel when you where with them ? (Objective measures)

# Fearless Symmetry
  - Not bad.  Good attempt to explain cutting edge math.
  - Tough going in the end, probably could have been done better.
  - Mathematical definitions create usage, not describe it.
  - Mathematical definitions cannot be wrong, only inconsistent or useless.
  - Lie group theory a marriage between calculus and group theory
  - Complex numbers forced on the world when solving CUBIC equiations. (Assumed x^2 + 1 = 0 had no solutions) Intermediate steps of the cubic equation involve imaginary numbers even though the final solutions are real.
  - Every root of a complex equation is already in C.
  - "2x3xR=C" the bible,  ie "pi = 3" the bible.
  - There is no (cannot be) a general method for finding all integer solutions to all systems of Z-equations in many variables
  - Pi is not in Q-Alg, this fact is apparently very hard to prove.
  - Not every number in Q-Alg can be obtained from the integers with repeated application of +,-,*,/ and ()^(1/n).
  - There is only one element of G (The absolute Galois Group) other than the identity which we can give a complete discription: complex conjugation.
  - A representation that is not faithful emphasizes certiant features of the sourse group and obscures others, enabling us to better understand the source group.
  - Some very large and complicated groups have been shown to be isomorphic to the Galois group of a poly-nominal (Including the Monster group)
  - Open conjectures: Poincare, Riemann Hypothesis, P==NP
  - Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated.
    (Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? )

# Poor Richards Almanac (Ben Franklin)
  - "No ugly lovers, no handsome prisons"
  - "Speak with contempt of none, from slave to king. The smallest bee has, (and will use) a sting"
  - Hear Reason, or shell make you feel here.
  - Make haste slowly
  - The way to see faith is to shut the eye of reason
  - Trick and treachery are the practice of fool , without the wit to be honest
  - When you speak to a man look at his eyes, when he speaks to you look at his mouth.
  - Observe all men, yourself the most
  - Wish not so much to live long, but to live well.
  - Eat to please yourself, dress to please others
  - Search others for their virtues, yourself for you vices.
  - Wink at small faults, remember you have great ones
  - Each year one vicious habit routed out, in time might made worst man good throughout.
  - Content makes poor men rich, Discontent makes rich men poor.
  - You can bear your own faults, why not the faults of your wife?
  - Why know the names, if you do not know the nature of things?
  - Learn from the skillful: He that teaches himself has a fool as a master
  - Great beauty, great strength, and great riches are really of no great use a right heart exceeds all.
  - Hes a fool that cannot conceal his wisdom
  - Fools make feasts, wise men eat them
  - Many complain of their memory, few of their judgment.
  - The eye of the master will do more work than his hand.
  - Whats given shines, whats received is rusty.
  - He is not well-bred that cannot bear ill-breading in others.
  - Eat to live, live not to eat.
  - To lengthen your life, lessen you meals.
  - The best physician knows the worthless-ness of most medicines.
  - He that wont be counseled, cannot be helped
  - People who are wrapped up in themselves make small packages.
  - Whatever begins in anger, ends in shame.
  - Keep eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards.
  - He that speaks much is much mistaken.
  - Prosperity discovers vice, adversity and virtue.
  - Many a man would have been worse if his estate had been better.
  - He that lives well is learned enough.
  - Reading makes a man full, meditation a profound man, discourse a clear man.
  - Its easier to suppress the first desire than all that follow.
  - He that pursues two hares at once, does not catch one and lets the other go.
  - Is there anything that man takes more pains about that to make themselves unhappy?
  - If you love life you will not squander time. Its what life is made of.
  - Good sense is something all need, few have, and none think they want.
  - Silence is not always a sign of wisdom, but babbling is always a sign of folly.
  - A long life might not always be good enough, but a good life is always long enough.
  - Suspicion may be no fault, but sharing it may be a great one
  - The end of passion (emotion) is the beginning of repentance.
  - Being ignorant is not so shameful as being unwilling to learn.
  - To be proud with knowledge is to be blind with light.
  - Men take more pains to mask than to mend.
  - Easier to build two chimneys than to maintain fuel in one.
  - The 12 virtues:
     1. Temperance: Dont eat to dullness or drink to elevation
     2. Silence: Speak only of what will benefit you or others. Avoid trifling conversation.

     12. Humility     

# Blood Meridian (Cormack McCarthy)
  - Good. Entertaining (A lot probably went over my head). Very gory. 
  - Dont actually have much that I took away.
  - "People see what they want to see".  "Then how come I ant seeing it now? I sure as want to."
  - "Books lie", "God dont lie", No said the judge, He does not and these are his words (holds up a chunk of rock) "He speaks in stones, trees, the bones of things"

# My Journey to the Nuclear Brink" (W. Perry)
  - Average overall. More of a memoir than anything.
  - During the Cuban missile crisis an American ICBM was launched. It was a routine test that no one thought to reschedule.
  - After missing a bid for a Govt. contract, start-up company went out and loaned their employees to other companies that had gotten the contract as a way to keep their talent in house.
  - "Megaton to Megawatts" project blended down Soviet uranium in old bombs for use in commercial power reactors in the US.
  - Upward progress in human violence and global political trends hopeful, but nuclear conflict could in blink be the ultimate reversal.
  - Our chief peril is poised nuclear doom, too far out of global public consciousness.
  - "Our problems are man-made, therefore, they can be solved by man" JFK
  - The problem is not how long it will take governments to reduce nukes to zero, but that governments now aren't moving at all. 
  - Key to constructive action to prevent nuclear weapons being used is education of the public.

# The Art of Worldly Wisdom (Baltasar Gracian) 
  - Great work!
  - Mix a little mystery with everything
  - A resolution declared in sever highly thought of, it only leaves room for criticism. 
  - Knowledge without courage is sterile (See Be the good) 
  - Create a feeling of dependence: Mores is to be got from dependence than from courtesy.
  - There is no rule higher than that over oneself, over ones impulses
  - Cultivate those who can teach you.  Reap applause for what you say, gain instruction from what you hear.
  - A bad manner spoils everything, even reason and justice
  - Be spotless. A single cloud can hide the whole of the sun.
  - Know how to take a hint. The truths which concern us most can only be half spoken, but with attention we can grasp then whole meaning. When you hear something favorable be skeptical. When you hear something unfavorable follow up.
  - Excellence in quality not quantity, much lowers value. Those who attempt to be at home everywhere are so nowhere. 
  - The smallest of current trump beats the ace of trumps last hand. 
  - Know your strongest points, your preeminent gift. Cultivate that and the rest will follow. 
  - Think things over, most over the most important. The wise man thinks over everything, but more profoundly where there is profound difficulty and thinks that perhaps there is more to it than he thinks. 
  - Recognize when things are ripe, and enjoy them.
  - Never exaggerate, its a branch of lying
  - Think with the few, speak with the many.
  - The wise man retires into silence and if he comes out of it he does so in the shade and before few and fit people.
  - Be thorough (Deserve the things you want)
  - Let your own standard of truth and righteousness be the standard.
  - Know how to choose well.
  - First you must be master over yourself if you would be master over others
  - Excel in what is excellent.
  - Neither give nor take bad news if unless you can't help it.
  - Elevate Taste: You can train taste like the intellect. Full knowledge whets desire, increases enjoyment.
  - Most things are not obtained simply because they are not attempted (See Be the good)
  - Self knowledge is the beginning of self-improvement
  - Know how to refuse: its as important to know how to consent.  A gilded no is more satisfactory than a dreary yes.
  - Bad execution of your designs does less harm than irresolution in forming them
  - Choose a heroic ideal: have a hero, not so much to follow as to spur you on into action. 
  - Notice men's moods and adapt yourself to each. 
  - Pushed to the extreme right becomes wrong. (Diminishing (negative) returns)
  - Wise men get more use from their enemies than fools get from their friends. Their enemies ill-will often levels mountains.
  - Let your behaviour be fine and noble: Most things must be left unnoticed among friends, relatives and even enemies.
  - Know yourself: In talents and capacity, in judgement and inclination. There are mirrors for the face, but none for the mind. Let careful thought (meditation)  and discussion among friends serve as a substitute. 
  - Dont not let your fortune on a single cast of the die. (Systems not Goals)
  - Obtain and preserve a reputation. 
  - Dignity: True kingship lies in spotless rectitude and he need to envy greatness who can serve as a model for it. Prefer to share in the qualities of royalty rather than take part in mere ceremony.
  - Good things when short are twice as good. (Well said is soon said) 
  - By joining extremes the more effective middle way is found.
  - Only act with honourable men. Dis-honorable ones are not constrained by virtue
  - Acquire the reputation of Courtesy: It is enough to make you liked. Politeness is the main ingredient in culture - a kind of witchery that wins the regard of all as surely as discourtesy gain their disfavor and opposition. It costs little and helps much. Everyone is honored who gives honor. Politeness and honor have the advantage that they stay with those who give them to others. 
  - It is preposterous to take to heart that which should ignore. Much that would be something has become nothing by being left alone, and what was nothing has become of consequence by being made much of. Often the remedy causes the disease. It is my no means the least of life's rules: to let things alone.
  - He is twice great who has all the perfections in the opinion of all except himself.  He attains applause by two opposite paths.
  - Learn to forget: (See perfection not required, especially in others)
  - Never Complain:  to complain always brings discredit.
  - Do and be seen doing: things do not pass for what they are but for what they seem. The observant are far fewer in number than the easily deceived by appearances.  A good exterior is the best recommendation for inner perfection. 
  - Revise your judgements (See feedback loop critical)
  - Do not nourish the spirit of contradiction. Finding problems in everything shows you're clever, but marks you a fool. Do not make war out of pleasant conversation. 
  - Find the good in a thing at once: There is nothing that has no good in it. Better to seize upon a single beauty out of 1000 defects.
  - Never from Obstinacy take the wrong side because your opponent has anticipated you in taking the right one. The sage never places himself on the side of passion but exposes the cause of right. 
  - Never become paradoxical in order to avoid the trite. (DFW!) Both extremes damage our reputation. Every undertaking which differs from the reasonable approaches foolishness.
  - Do not show your wounded finger. Ill will searches for wounds to irritate. 
  - Have the art of conversation. No act in life requires more attention.  You must either lose or gain by it. If it needs care to write a letter (which is after all just deliberate conversation) how much more for ordinary conversation in which there is occasion for a prompt display of intelligence.
  - Think before hand. Better to sleep on something before than to lie away about it after.
  - The whole of life should be one course of thought how not to miss the right path.  Rumination and foresight enable one to determine the lie of life.
  - The art of NOT getting into a passion: The first step to getting into a passion is to announce that you are in a passion.  It is great proof of wisdom to remain clear-sighted during paroxysms of rage. Every excess of passion is a digression from rational conduct. To keep control of passion one must hold firm the reins of attention.x
  - Select your friends. Intelligence brings friends to some, chance to most. 
  - Dont make mistakes of/about character. "Better to be cheated on the price than in the quality of the goods"
  - Be careful in speaking. There is always time to add a word, never to withdrawal one. Talk as if you were making your will, the fewer words the less litigation.
  - All deformity of mind is more obnoxious than that of body because it contravenes a higher beauty.
  - Be more careful not to miss once than to hit 1000 times. ("Dont give a bad talk") No one looks at the blazing sun, all gaze when he is eclipsed.
  - Many would be wise if they did not think themselves wise. The oracles of wisdom are rare, they are rarely used. To seek advice does not lessen greatness or argue incapacity. 
  - Trust your heart. Never deny it a hearing. It is a kind of oracle that often foretells the most important.
  - Be a solid man: "Only truth can give a true reputation"
  - You must moderate your opinion of others so you dont fear them.  (Many appear great until you know them personally)
  - Do not hold your views too firmly. Every fool is fully convinced and every fully persuaded is a fool. Steadfastness should be for the will not the mind.
  - Do not be ceremonious: Its right to demand respect, but not to be seen as master of ceremonies. "He cannot be great who is great at such little things"
  - Do pleasant things yourself, do unpleasant things through others. A great man takes more pleasure in doing a favor than in receiving one.
  - Be the bearer of praise: This shows we have learned what is excellent. Gives material for conversation.
  - Know how to appreciate: Wise men appreciate all men, for they see the good in each and know how hard it is to make anything good.
  - Find a proper place by merit, not presumption. "Deserve what you want"
  - Attempt easy tasks as if they were difficult, difficult tasks as if they were easy (Systems, not goals)
  - Be Moderate: Moderation serves as a counter point to the impulses of passions (emotions) especially in sudden emergencies. Much thought is needed to prevent emotion from taking over. 
  - Do not turn one blunder into two. The worst of a bad case is having to fight it.
  - Be expressive: without cleverness the children of the mind (thought and judgements) cannot be brought into the world.
  - Never act form stubbornness but from knowledge. All stubbornness is an outgrowth of the mind, a grandchild of emotion which never did do anything right. There are people that make war out of everything. Dont do that. 
  - Sincerity should not degrade into simplicity, nor sagacity into cunning.
  - Never take anything against the grain. Everything has a smooth or a seamy side. Many things cause pain which should cause pleasure if you regarded their advantages. 
  - Do not be the slave of first impressions. Dont satisfy your will with the first object nor your mind with the first preposition. Wait for the 3rd or 4th edition of the news.
  - Plan your life wisely, with prudence and foresight. 
  - The very wise are generally easily deceived, for while they know esoterica they do not know the ordinary things of life. Of what use is knowledge if it is not practical? To know how to live is true knowledge. 
  - Know a little more, live a little less. To be at ease is better than to be at business. All we have is time. It is unfortunate to waste your precious life in both mechanical or important work. 
  - Many men do not esteem what they understand and venerate what they do not see.  Many praise a thing without being able to say why if asked. 
  - Few can do us good, almost any can do us harm. 
  - Be able to forget: Memory is unruly and stupid. It leaves us in lurch when needed and puts its nose into places its not wanted. Cultivate good habits of memory, it can make life heaven or hell. 
  - Have a touch of the trader: The very wise are generally easily deceived, for while why exotica, they do not know the ordinary things of life. Of what use is knowledge if it is not practical? To know how to live is true knowledge. 
  - Do not condemn alone that which pleases all. There must be good in a thing that pleases so many. If you cannot find the good look. Bad taste springs from want of knowledge. 
  - In all things if you know little, stick to the safest. To know little and seek danger is to seek ruin. "Security is schrewder than singularity".	 
  - Beware of the gossip; He is either a blabber or a spy.
  - Find favor with men of sense: The tepid yes of remarkable men is worth more than all the applause of the vulgar. Even monarchs need authors and fear their pens more than ugly women the camera.
  - Never act from emotion: If you do all is lost. You cannot act for yourself if you are not yourself. Emotion/Passion drives out reason. You need to interpose a prudent go-between who keeps cool. As soon as you notice you are losing your temper, beat a wise retreat.
  - Live for the moment, not  by certain fixed rules, except those of cardinal virtues. The wise man knows that prudence lies in steering by the wind. (BJJ)
  - More important to know men than to know minerals.
  - Aspire to be a hero than merely appear to be one.
  - Always act as if you were seen.


# Crime and Punishment
  - Overall entertaining, but I would say, not profound.
  - Probably missed a lot in between the lines.	
  - "Words are not deeds"
  - "Would not one tiny crime be wiped out by the thousands of good deeds?"
  - "We have to correct and direct nature, and but for that we should drown in an ocean of prejudice."
  - "If you would not do it yourself, there is no justice in it."
  - "Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world relies on self-interest"
  - "In acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am, so to speak, for all."
  - "Through error you come to the truth! I am a man b/c I err. You never reach truth without making 14 mistakes and very likely 114."
  - "To go wrong in ones own way is better than to go right in someone else"  (Not sure I agree...)
  - "I maintain that all great men... must by their very nature be criminals. Otherwise its hard for them to get out of the common rut"
  - "and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing"
  - "Have you seen the butterfly round a candle ? Freedom  will lose its attractions"
  - "if one waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long"
  - "if you convince a person logically that he has nothing to cry about, he'll stop crying." Response: "Life would be too easy if that were true"
  - "Nothing is harder than speaking the truth and nothing is easier than flattering. If there is a 1/100 part of false note in speaking the truth it leads to discord. But if all is false in flattery it is just as agreeable"
  - "The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence"


# Hacking Darwin (Metzl) 
  - Average. Good start, very repetitive, lot of fluff (could have been 1/2 as long) 
  - 3.8B years ago single cell organisms emerged.
  - Sex invented 1.3B years ago (accelerated evolution) 
  - Claim: Now the principles of Darwinian evolution are evolving 
  - Will soon see conception through sex as unnecessarily dangerous
  - Humans have about 21k genes, 3.2B base pairs
  - epigenetics regulates how our DNA is expressed
  - "Worlds most valuable resource no longer oil, but data"
  - Generalized Medicine (based on population averages) will be seen to be the equivalent of leaches. 
  - Wont need complete understanding (of healthcare or genetics) to deploy growing knowledge w/confidence.
  - 500B sperm cells for men vs 400 total eggs for women. 
  - sperm and eggs have been generate from skin cells and used to give birth to healthy mice. 
  - Scientists already viable offspring from two male mice. 
  - Wild chicken: 1egg/ month  Domesticated 30/month (Only 8k years to change without "Bio Tech")
  - Most cells in your body turn over every two years (on average) 
  - 28 years for humans to pass a generation 6 months for chickens
  - Breeding preimplented embryos with each other can accelerate the turn over in humanss. 
  - Arctic apples can be sliced and left out with out browning b/c scientists have used CRISPER to silence genes controlling browning
  - 37 genes are in the mitochondria. 
  - Aging is probably a combination of many different systems in the body all decaying at different rates
  - Aging is the leading cause of death among humans (diseases that kill us most are from aging. Curing any one will not help much) 
  - Eliminating cancer will buy us 3 years
  - "I've only had one wrinkle in my life, and I'm sitting on it" - Jean Calment (122) 
  - Lifestyle choices significantly impact the epigenetic instructions 
  - "Nature is clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel" - Darwin
  - We will never have perfect knowledge of the genome just like we never had perfect knowledge of fire before we started harnessing it, cancer before we started treating it,  or domesticated crops before we started eating them
  - Optimism and hubris is built into our operating systems 
  - Bostrom's "Reversal Test" - If some people feel that making a change in one direction is bad, they should articulate why doing the opposite (actively) would be justified. 
  - Eugenics 60k Americans were sterilized without acquiescence / Nazis did 400k Germans
  - Diversity has been and remains sole survival strategy of our species


# Mental Models Part 1 (The knowledge project)
  - See mental models section


# Extreme Ownership (Jocko Wilnick) 
 - Very good
 - Overly wordy, but many good points
 - Extreme Ownership: 
 
   > requires looking at reality objectively. Without emotional attachment, agenda, or plans
 
   > requires leader to set aside ego/accept responsibility for failure
 
 - There are no bad teams, only bad leaders
 - Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance
 - Ego clouds/disrupts everything (most difficult ego to deal with is your own) 
 - *Cover and Move*: "The most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic"
 - "Relax, look around and make a call" (Detach)
 - For any team, it is essential to develop standardized planning process
 - *Commanders Intent* most important part of brief
 - Giving front-line troops ownership of even small piece of plan gets buy-in
 - Best teams employ constant analysis of tactics and measure effectiveness to adapt
   > Done through post-operational debrief. What went right ? wrong ? more effective ?
 - Paramount that senior leaders explain to jr leaders their role and how it fits the big picture
 - One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your Boss. 
 - Factors for leadership (leading up and down the chain of command)
   > Take responsibility for everyone in your world: subordinates and superiors

   > If someone isn't doing what you want/need, determine what you can do to enable

   > Dont ask your lead what you should do, tell them what you are going to do
 - Dichotomy of Leadership (see 80/20 and diminishing returns)
   > Confident not cocky 
   
   > Leader and follower
   
   > Quiet not silent

   > competitive but gracious

   > humble not passive

   > calm not robotic 

   > attentive but not obsessed by detail

   > aggressive not over-bearing

   > Extreme Ownership vs Decentralized Command
 - This is simple, not easy: Be Honest. Show Integrity. Take ownership.
 - Dont do the leadership "comb-over"
 - Good performance comes from Rehearsal
 - When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
    > "Why am I intimidated by this situation? "

    > Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader. 
 -  IF you have a weak leader: LUCKY YOU! 
    > Have an opportunity to take advantage and LEAD
    
    > Do what you want. Motivate yourself ! Take charge. Take advantage. 
 - Start with micromanagement and morph into de-centralized command.
 - The worst thing you can do if you make a mistake is to avoid taking blame for it
 - Build Trust: Do what you say and say what you do. 
 - When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: That's a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"


# Ten Discoveries that Rewrote History (Patrick Hunt)
 - Rosetta Stone - key to Egyptian writing: hieroglyphs
 - Troy - Discipline of archaeology started here. Soil and whats in it also can be read like books. Established truth behind Homeric poems.
 - Nineveh Library - Collection of 20k tablets form 1st military empire: Assyrians. Known for cruelty. Capital city burned. 
 - Machu Picchu - Spectacular natural beauty. Hidden city of Incas Peru. 
 - King tuts tomb - Superstar in modern world, barely relevant to ancient Egypt. Riches in minor tomb staggering even to modern standards. 
 - Pompeii - Eyewitness record of eruption. City well-preserved, mid existence. Tells us much about ancient Roman life. ("More Important than Rome")
 - Dead Sea Scrolls - Oldest biblical documents. Odd history of being kept from public.
 - Thera - Possibly Atlantis. Minoan island that different volcanic eruption.
 - Olduvai gorge - The key to human evolution. Most distant human relatives
 - Tomb of 10k warriors - Key to understanding how China unified. 


# Breath: the new science of a lost art
 - Fantastic
 - 90% of us are breathing incorrectly, deteriorated over ages (dysevolution) 
 - molecules you breath in build your bones, (we "eat air") 
 - o2 produces 16x the energy than c02
 - Two ways body makes energy from air/food
 
   > w/o2 aerobic - after warm up body switches to aerobic during workout
 
   > w/o o2 anaerobic - uses glucose quick easy inefficient, can be toxic. What 1st min of intense exercise sucks
 
 - Interior of nose blanketed with erectile tissue. 
 - Mouth breathing #1 cause of cavities
 - Greatest indicator of life-span is lung capacity
 - Internal organs are malleable
 - We have 100x more c02 in our bodies than o2.
 - We exhale more than we breath in, 85% of fat loss through CO2
 - CO2 is the chief hormone in the body, only one that is produced by every tissue and acts on every organ.
 - Lungs absorb only about 1/4 of the available o2
 - Prayer heals, esp when its practiced at 5.5. breaths/min
 - Just as we've been a culture of over eaters, we've also become a culture of over breathers
 - With some effort and training, breathing less can become unconscious habit. 
 - When we breath too much, expel too much c02, blood pH rises: more alkaline
 - When we breath too slow,  hold more c02 -> pH lower: more acidic.
 - All the tenderizing and cooking eventually lead to airway obstruction.
 - Breathing is the power switch to the eautonomic nervous system. 
 - Lungs connected to nerves in parasympathetic in lower lobes. Why long/slow breaths are relaxing.
 - Sympathetic nerves located on the top of the lungs
 - Vegas nerve turns organs on and off in response to stress
 - Amygdala the alarm circuit of fear
 - Chemo-receptors in brain-stem monitor changes in CO2 and alarm the brain 
 - Chemo-receptors flexibility is part of what distinguishes good and great athletes
 - Breathing slow, less and through the nose balances the level of respiratory gases in the body and send max O2 to max tissues for max electron reactivity.
 - "If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to one tip it would be to simply learn how to breath better"
 - Humming increases the release of nitric oxide in the nasal passage. 
 - Mouth-breathing causes body to lose 40% more water during sleep
 - Mouth-breathing also make you urinate more. Pituitary gland in base of brain secretes hormones that controls vasopressin, which communicates to cells to store more H20.
 - If not in deep sleep (eg from chronic sleep apnea) vasopressin wont release and we will have to urinate more. 


# David Foster Wallace Bio ("Every Love Story Is a Ghost Story")
  - Good 
  - Serous mental problems, Big pot and alcohol problems, big into AA.
  - Interested in Buddhism
  - "The world is everything that is the case" (Tractatus. Wallace though one of the best opening lines in western it.)
    - Does our understanding of what we experience derive from objective reality or from cognitive limitations with us ? (Is language window or cage?)
  - Do we have real existence outside of what we do/say/perceive? Are these really under our control? 
  - Infinite Jest: 
  
    > Are we choosing what to love carefully enough ?
  
    > "Generation too afraid to say what it meant, and so in danger of fretting it had anything to say. 
  
    > Suddenly, for Wallace, sincerity was a virtue and saying what you meant a calling.
  
    > "One of the points of Infinite Jets is that the center is empty" (inside Hal there's pretty much nothing at all, he knows)
  
  - This is water
  
    > The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily conscious"
  
    > Learning how to think really means being aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to **choose** how you construct meaning from experience


# Fumble Rules (guide to grammar and usage)
 - Overly clever, not enough actionable information.
 - Some of it: kill "with regard to", "with reference to", "on account of", "by means of", "as regards", "with the exception of"


# Stoic Test Challenge (William Irvine)
 - Great Book!
 - Definitely changed my life for the better. 
 - Philosophy of life: what in life is worth having and what is a strategy for obtaining it. 
 - Now w/after life, but about time on earth.
 - All about stoic tests (see Respond, don't React (Employ Stoic Test Strategy))
 - What up sets people is not the setbacks in themselves, but there judgements of them. 


# Breakfast of Champions (Kurt Vonnegut)
 - Didn't really get it. Was obviously a lot of cleaver stuff going on, most of it was over my head. 
 - "I thank those lusts (of gold and seeing little girls underpants) for being so ridiculous for they taught us that it was possible for a human being to believe anything"
 - "Ideas on earth were badges of friendship. Friends agreed with friends to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with  enemies in order to express enmity."
 - "Seems like the only kind of job an American can get these days is committing suicide in some way"
 - I wont know myself until I find out whether life is serious or not"
