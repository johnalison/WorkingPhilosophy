# Personal MBA (Josh Kaufman)

- Very good overall (probably to low level for me)

- Formal bussiness degrees often not worth the money. What you learn is very useful, but there are more efficient (and cheaper!) ways to learn it.

- "Life is tough, its tougher if you're stupid" --John Wayne

- "Education is not the answer to a question, it is the means to answer all questions" -- Bill Allin

- "The limits of my language are the limits of my world" -Wittgenstein

- "Whoever best describes the problem is the one most likely to solve it" -- Dan Roam

- Your brain works with a lattice work of mental models. The key is to understand the most fundamental models -- the ones that do most of the heavy lifting.
  You can outthink smarter people if you hone your mental models and train yourself to be objective and multidisciplinary.

- Even though we are constantly surrounded by it, bussiness is one of the most complex and multidisciplinary human activites.

- Definition of a Bussiness:
  1) provides value that 2) other people want/need 3) at a price they are willing to pay, in a way that 4) satisifies the purchasers needs and expectations and 5) provides enough revenue to be self-sufficient.
   (Bussiness is a process of identifying a problem and finding a way to solve it that benifits both parties.)

- What do people need/want ?
   Maslows core human drives: physiologic / safety / belonging / esteem and self-actualization. 
   ERG theory: people desire: existence/relatedness and growth (in this order)

- Working on the right thing is more important that working hard.

- Have options or flexibility is an often overlooked/underated form of value.

- The job of an entrepreneur is not to come up with ideas (that is the easy part) but to discover if an idea can work in reality.

- "Better to be roughly right than precisely wrong" -- John Maynard keynes
