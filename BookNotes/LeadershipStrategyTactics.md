# Leadership Strategy and Tactics (Jocko Willink)

- Short and Sweet.  Lots of good take-aways elaberations.

- To Detach, Step one is to be aware. Pay attention to yourself and what is happening around you.

- He seemed like a tactical genious. But what I realized later was that he was detached from the planning process, so he could see it from altitude and easily see where the holes were.

- If your boss has a bad plan. Put the onus in yourself as to why the idea from your boss doesnt make sense.  How much will be gained by approaching the boss and trying to convince them to change their plan ? IF the differnce is minimal, its is probably not worth investing any time or effort into it. Next, ask yourself how much of your concern is just your ego. Lastly, ask yourself if you will be moving your relationship with your boss forward or backward by raising this issue.

- People almost always like their own ideas better than anyone else's.

- Good leaders filnd other people to bring onto the team who compensate for their shortfalls.

- Truth and honest are perhaps the most essential of leadership qualities. Tell the truth to your people. Tell the truth to your boss. Tell the truth to your peers. And, of course, tell the truth to yourself.

- Subordinates will actually respect the leader more if they come and try to learn and perform the task. eg: the CEO of an equipment manufacturer should go and build a product from beginning to end at least once a month so they are always in touch with the process.

- To build trust and relationships down the chain of command, you have to **_give_** trust. If I want my subordinates to trust me, I need to give them trust.

- What starts out as micromanagement becomres more and more hands-off.

- To build respect and influence, you have to give respect and influence. Treat people with respect. All them to give their opinion. Listen to them. Dont interrupt them. dont disparage the importance of their job or position. Share the burden of hard tasks. IF you want to have influence over others, you need to allow them to have influence over you. That means when you listen to them, you actally **_listen_**. You consider their recommendations and, whenever possible, you incorporate their thoughts and ideas into what you are trying to accomplish. You keep and open mind.

- There are times when people will say and do things that make no sense. There are times when things will not go the way you want. When this happens, good leaders remain levelheaded. Dont get agitated. Keep you emotions in check. Take measured account of the situation. Keep you opinions to yourself as you analyze, logically, what is actually happening.

- Everyone is the same, but everyone is differnt. The better a leader understand this dichotomy, the better they will understand people. Therea re archetylap people in every organization. There characters are everywhere; people are the same. However, they have differnet motivations, differnt agendas, differnt idiosyncrasies, and different ideas. As much as you can categorize someone as a "leader" or a "loner", they are all still completely different from other leaders and other loners you have worked with.

- One of the thinkgs that distinguishes a jiu-jitsu black belt from a white belt is the black belt's understanding of what is important and what isnt.

- A good rule to follow is that a leader should err on the side of not getting involved in problems; the goal is always to allow problems to get solved at the lowest level.

- The attitude you takt with any tema should be that everyones job is absolutely critical.

- Instead of me forcing my plan on them, I would have them go back to the drawing board, take the lessons they had just learned from their bad plan, and come up with a new one of their own. This alls them to have true buy-in and ownershop of it.  Let your subordinates come up with the plan. Not only will it result in their taking ownershop it will also give you the standoff distance and attitude you need to see holes in it. The biggest obstacle in allowing subordinates leaders to come up with a plan is your ego.

- If you want optimal performance, dont just count on your brain power. Instead encourage the rest of your team to think and question you.

- Be balanced. Extreme actions and opinions are usually not good.

- If you are worried that you arent ready for a leadership position , that means you are humble.

- If your team members want to do something a certian way, your goal should be to **_let them do it that way_**.

- For leaders there is such a thing as a dumb question.

- The true way to overcome your insecurities is to admit them to yourself, air them to the team, and then work to improve them.

- The people who taught me the most about leadershop, strategy and tactics never explicitly told me that they were coaching or mentoring me; they subtly guided me along the path, filling my head with knowledge, while I barely even noticed it. The best leaders I worked for where also increadibly subtle. Very  rarely did they come right out and give direct orders stating exactly what to do and how to do it. The best leaders usually led not by orders but by suggestion.

- Because the leader has been restrained from constantly making decisions for the group, when they do step in and make a call, it will be respected.

- Even if you are in charge, if there is someone with a good plan who is giving direction to move in the right way, that's fine; take a step back and let them lead. Be a follower.

- Tactic: You might want to hesitate a moment when you see that leadershop vacuum apear. That is a tactic that I used as a leader thoughout my career.  If there was a problem unfolding slowly, dont rush to take charge; let the problem develop a little bit. Look around, detach mentally, and truly observe the situation. Confirm that what you are seeing is correct. Allow an opportunity for someone else to step up and fill the leadership vacuum - and if someone else does -- internally assess their plan and the directions they are giving. If they are giving good guidance, support them. If they give bad guidance, continue to consider what a better plan would be, so you cna give corrections when the time is right.  By giving those last few moment to allow things to develop, the call you make will be beter.

- Even when someone who you dont think is on your level, someone who isnt even close to having the knowledge, position, or authority to give you one iota of feedback wants to speak, even then, do youself a favor and just listen. Detach and listen to what they have to say and, from an objective mind-set, see if you cna learn anything at all from their commentary. Then apply it. And say thank you. I know that stings. Get over yourself.

- Arguing is generally bad. It means wasting time without moving forward -- and what is worse, people often argue not for the **_best idea_**  but for **_their idea_**
