# Reframe Your Brain (Scott Adams)

- Refames dont need to be rational or logical, they just need to work.

- Everything you experience rewires your brain. I'm teaching you how to do it strategically instead of randomly

- The first thing I think when something falls apart is that an opportunity has been created.

  I still deal with the problem of course, but Ive rewired my brain via repetition to look for the upside.

- I fail at 90% of the things I try ---> I only need to succeed 10 percent of the time.

- I want to do XXXX ---> I have decided to do XXXX

- Cultivate a reputation that can handle being spectacularly wrong without offending your sense of self, do that.

  It will make you the only person in the room who can see the whole field.

- A big downside of long-term goals withough systems is that every day you do not meet the goal, you are in a mental state of something like failure.

  But when you have a system, you can feel success every day.


- Your best odds of happiness are closely associated with how flexible your talent stack is.

  Focus on being excellent at a skill that has commercial value ---> Acquire skills that __work well together__ and make you rare and flexible at the same time.

  Brig Williams: "Do not become a commodity"

- Another problem! Why me? ---> Ooh, a new puzzle to solve.

- Ugh, I hate this repetitive chore --> I can do this chore so gracefully and efficiently it feels like a game.

- Dont give something for nothing --> Giving triggers reciprocity (on average)

- Best piece of career advice: always give more than is expected of you.

  When you do that you instantly stand out as a person of character.

  Doing more than expected is almost always doable.

  There is no simpler formula for social and career sucess.

  Do your job --> Do more than your job.

- Succes depends on who you know ---> Succes depends on how many people you know.

- Honesty is a rare superpower.  Keeping your word consistently creates an asset that is hard to compete with in todays sketchy world

- Favor action over caution when the cost of taking the wrong action is low.

- If you see someone do something wrong, the normal impulse is to point out the error and explain how to do it right.

  This is OK in life or death situations --- get to the point.

  But most things are not urgent. Much of life involves teaching people how to do something you know how to do but they dont.

  People generally want to do good work. Showing someone a better way is often all you need.

  People usually know when they mess up and why.

  Tell people what they did wrong so they avoid it next time --> Tell people what they did well so they are motivated to continue repeating it.

- The universe is acting agianst me --> the universe owes me.

- Do wait around for luck. Luck needs you to do its part which usually looks like this.
  - Work on your fitness and health
  - Build your talent stack
  - Meet more people
  - Go where there is more energy
  - Create systems for you success

- The concept of fairness is useful in sports, relationships and other situations, but it is a big abstacle to success.

  Fairness is a desirable social goal  --> Fairness is the enemy of success.

- The way I experince creativity is as river of ideas flowing through my consciousness. Nearly all of them are bad or imcomplete, and my brain
  flushes them as quickly as they arrive. But every so often, I get a physical sensation from an idea. It might cause me to laugh, get goosebumps,
  or get excited about a project. Thats the good one. I dont creat ideas. I simply select the best from the stream as it passes and I identify the good ones
  by how they make me feel.

- Compare youself to where you were yesterday or where you started

  You feel like a fraud. Everyone else is competent --> Your are learning fast! Look at all you learned.

- Its better to say the boy hit the ball than the ball was hit by the boy.

- Nuke the adverbs

- For most types of writting  the best sentence is the simplest one that gets the message across.
  If you use words that a 12 year old would understand, you will sound like the smartest person in the conversation.

  Simple sentences are better in every way.

- Good writting makes the reader feel something. Especially for humor. Use you body as a sensor  to know when you write someting funny or emotionally persuasive.

- I am my inner thoughts --> I am what I do.

- The best way to talk yourself out of feeling judged by others is to stop judging others. Lose that frame.
  When you judge others on a subjective frame of goodness and badness , you are buying into your own destruction.
  The more you think of others as good and bad, the more you will suspect people are judging you because that will become your go-to frame.

- Hate is nothing bug punishing yourself for the misdeeds of others.

- One of the greatest keys to happiness and good health involves managing stress and anxiety.
  It wont matter to your happiness how many skills you acquire over the course of your life if you dont also learn how to control how you feel.

- Embarrassments dont last. It makes it easy to ignore the next potential embarrassment.

- Immunity to shaming is one of the most usefull business and professional skills you can acquire
   (counter point: shaming is a signal, might have some value)

- I worry something will go wrong --> Im curious what will happen.

- Look for situations in your life where you can reasonably "do everything you can do" to improve the situation.
  Notice how much better you fell no matter if things go wrong or right from that point on.

- Fitness is a gift that keeps on giving. It touches all aspects of your life and is highly controllable.
  So control the fuck out of it and see how much better you feel. Same with diet.
  Eating right and exercising are not easy. But they are 100% availible to all interested takers.
  Get control of your diet and exercise and watch how the benefits start solving your other problems

- If something is too small to be remembered on you final day of consciousness, what are the odds its important now?

- If you have problems, your brain will pounce and -- for many of us -- never release.
  Thats exactly what you want if your problem is one that can be solved.
  But reality is too messy. Many of our most vexing problems exist entirely inour minds.

- "Less is more" is a powerful bit of programming code that makes everything it touches seem persuasive.
  Use that to your advantage.

- People love to hear their own names. Its an easy and instant bonding technique Be a name-user.
  Make it your superpower to remember names. All it takes is focus and effort.
