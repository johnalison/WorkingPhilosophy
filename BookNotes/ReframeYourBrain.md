# Reframe Your Brain (Scott Adams)

- Refames dont need to be rational or logical, they just need to work.

- Everything you experience rewires your brain. I'm teaching you how to do it strategically instead of randomly

- The first thing I think when something falls apart is that an opportunity has been created.

  I still deal with the problem of course, but Ive rewired my brain via repetition to look for the upside.

- I fail at 90% of the things I try ---> I only need to succeed 10 percent of the time.

- I want to do XXXX ---> I have decided to do XXXX

- Cultivate a reputation that can handle being spectacularly wrong without offending your sense of self, do that.

  It will make you the only person in the room who can see the whole field.

- A big downside of long-term goals withough systems is that every day you do not meet the goal, you are in a mental state of something like failure.

  But when you have a system, you can feel success every day.


- Your best odds of happiness are closely associated with how flexible your talent stack is.

  Focus on being excellent at a skill that has commercial value ---> Acquire skills that __work well together__ and make you rare and flexible at the same time.

  Brig Williams: "Do not become a commodity"

- Another problem! Why me? ---> Ooh, a new puzzle to solve.

- Ugh, I hate this repetitive chore --> I can do this chore so gracefully and efficiently it feels like a game.

- Dont give something for nothing --> Giving triggers reciprocity (on average)

- Best piece of career advice: always give more than is expected of you.

  When you do that you instantly stand out as a person of character.

  Doing more than expected is almost always doable.

  There is no simpler formula for social and career sucess.

  Do your job --> Do more than your job.

- Succes depends on who you know ---> Succes depends on how many people you know.

- Honesty is a rare superpower.  Keeping your word consistently creates an asset that is hard to compete with in todays sketchy world

- Favor action over caution when the cost of taking the wrong action is low.

- If you see someone do something wrong, the normal impulse is to point out the error and explain how to do it right.

  This is OK in life or death situations --- get to the point.

  But most things are not urgent. Much of life involves teaching people how to do something you know how to do but they dont.

  People generally want to do good work. Showing someone a better way is often all you need.

  People usually know when they mess up and why.

  Tell people what they did wrong so they avoid it next time --> Tell people what they did well so they are motivated to continue repeating it.
