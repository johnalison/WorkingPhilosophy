# How the World Really Works (Vaclav Smil)

- Fantastic. Might be a new favorite author!

- Lines etched into the most powerful processors are only about twice the diameter of human DNA.

- None of the people reading this book will relocate to Mars. all of us will continue to eat staple grain crops grown in soil on large expanses of argicultural land, rather than in skyscrapers imagined by the proponents of so-called urban agriculture.

- The prescription is easy: "Just decarbonize" switch from burning fossil fuels to converting inexhaustible flows of renewable energies. The real wrench in the works: we are a fossil-fueled civilization whose techinical and scientific advances, quality of life, and prosperity rest on the combustion of huge quantities of fossil carbon, and we cannot simply walk away from this critical determinant of our fortunes in a few decades, nevermind years.

- This book is an attempt to explain some of the most fundamental ruling realities governing our survival and our prosperity.

- Our high-energy societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels in general and on electricity, the most flexible form of energy, in particular.

- Decarbonizing trucking, flying and shipping will be a much greater challenge (than decarbonizing electricity) as will the production of key materials without relying on fossil fuels.

- Producing our food requires substantial, direct and indirect fossil fuel inputs.

- it would be very difficult to run all field machinery without liquid fossil fuels and to produce all fertilizers without natural gas and oil.

- Four pillars of modern civilization: ammonia, steel, concrete, and plastics.

- My main area of interest throughout my life has been energy studies, because a satisfactory grasp of that vast field requires a combining an understanding physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and energineering with an attention to history and to social, economic and political factors.

- This book strongly advocates for miving away from extreme views.

- In fundamental physics any process can be defined as a sequence of energy conversions.

- Fire converts the chemical energy of plants into thermal energy and light.

- Our increasing dependence on fossil fuels is the most important factor in explaining the advances of modern civilization and also underlies our concerns about the vulnerability of their supply and the enviromental impacts of their combustion.

- Energy conversions are the very basis of life and evolution, so tracing the trajectory of useful energy is revealing. Modern history can be seen as anusually rapid sequence of transitions to new energy sources, and the modern world is the cumulative result.

- The economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services. Energy is the only truly universal currency, and nothing can take place without its transformations. Its hard to understand why modern economics has largely ignored energy. Understanding how the world really works cannot be done without energy literacy.

- Synthesis of ammonia needed to produce nitrogenous fertilizers depends heavily on natural gas as the source of hydrogen.

- Large nuclear reactors are the most reliable producers of electricity.

- Natrual gas containss 35 MJ/m^3 or less than 1/1000 of kerosenes density.

- There could be no natural-gas powered flight: the energy density of methane is 3 orders of magnitude lower than aviation kerosene.
  There could be no coal powered flight:  the enrgy differnce is not very large, but coal would not flow from wing tanks to the engines

- Unlike coal, crude oil is much easier to produce, store, and distribute.

- Asphalt is derived from crude oil.

- Hydro carbons are feedstocks for many different chemical syntheses.

- Currents above 100 miliamps may be deadly.

- Electricity only suplies ~20% of the final global energy consumption.
  - Nuclear fission is 10% of electricity generation
  - Hydro is 16% of electricity generation
  - solar is 7%
  - The rest is from coal and natural gas

- At the 2020 levels of production, coal reserves would last another 120 years, oil and gas for about 50 years

- Even with an abundant and reliable renewable electricity supply, we would still have to develop large-scale processes to produce steel, ammonia, cement and plastics.

- Both the high relative share and the scale of our dependence on fossile carbon make any rapid substitutions impossible.

- Until a few generations ago, only a small share of well-fed elites did not have to worry about having enough to eat.

- The modern worlds most important -- and fundamentally existential -- dependence on fossil fuels is their direct and indirect use in the production of our food. Direct use includes fuels to power all field machinery, the transportation of harvest from fields, and irrigation pumps.  Indirect use is much broader and includes fertilizers.
   Most of the dependence is on liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in machine fuels and raw materials.
   
- As always we are eating products of photosynthesis.  What has changed is the intensity of our crop and animal production: we could not harvest such abundance and in such a highly predictable manner, without  the still-rising inputs of fossil fuels and electricity.

- Agriculture must be energized by solar radiation, specifically by the blue and red parts of the visible spectrum. photosynthesis is a multi-step process that combines atmospheric carbon dioxide and water -- as well as small amounts of elements including most notably notrogen and phosphorus -- to produce new plant mass for crops.

- Two centuries ago, the addition of non-solar forms of energy began to affect the crop production and later also the capture or marine species.

- High-productivity harvests are possible thanks to increasing infusions of fossil energies. Coal is used to make metallurgical coke charged into blast furnances, and cast iron is converted to steel in open hearth furnaces. Steel is needed for agricultural machinery as well as for making the means of transportation.

- In two centuries, the human labor to produce a kilogram of American wheat was reduced from 10 minutes to less than 2 seconds.

- The road to the modern world began with inexpensive steel plows and inorganic fertilizers.

- Fertilizers that supply the three essential plant marconutrients -- nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium -- are needed in large quantities to ensure high crop yields.
  - Potassium is the least costly to produce, as all it takes is potash (KCl) from surface or underground mines.
  - Ammonia is the starting compound for making all synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers (the most important indirect energy input in modern farming)
      Nitrogen is needed in such large quantities because it is in every living cell: it is in chlorophyll (which powers photosynthesis),  DNA and RNA (which stores genetic information), and in amino acids, which makde up all the proteins required for the growth and maintenence of our tissues. The element is abundant -- it makes up nearly 80% of the atmosphere, organisms live submerged it it -- and yet it is a key limiting factor in crop productivity as well as in human growth. This is one of the great paradoxical realities of the biosphere and its explanation is simple: nitrogen exists in the atmosphere as a non-reactive molecule (N_2) and only a few natural processes can split the bond between the two nitrogen atoms and make the element availble to form reactive compounds.


- Ammonia NH_3 is a highly reactive compound that is readily converted into soluble nitrates that can supply plants with their nitrogen needs.

- Leguminous food crops, including soybeans, beans, peas, lentils, and peanuts, are able to provide (fix) their own nitrogen.  But no stable grain, oil crop or tuber can do that.

- For now and the forseeable future, we cannot feed the world without relying on fossil fuels.

- Feeding efficiency over the past five decades have shown now improvements for either beef or pork, but impressive gains for chicken. Producing one American chicken (whose average edible weight is almost exactly 1 kg) needs 3 kg of corn.  The total energy use (in mL equivalent of diesel fuel) is 300-350 mL/kg for chicken, which is remarkably efficient compared to 210-250 mL/kg for bread, is US cities the average price of a kg of white bread is only about 5% lower than the price per kg of whole chicken. This helps to explain the rapid rise of chicken to become the dominant meat in all Western countries.

- The gains in energy cost of vegetables is surprisingly high.

- Turns out that capturing seafood is the most energy intensive process of food provision.  The marine species that people prefer to eat are carnivorous and need to be fed protein-righ fish meals and fish oil.

- Anthropogenic energy inputs to modern feild farming add up to only about 4% of the annual global energy use. This sounds small, but it must be remembered that the Sun will always do most of the work of growing food. It is also a demonstration of small inputs having disproportionately large consequences, not an uncommon finding in the behaviuour of complex systems.

- For the US, the grand total of energy use in food production is ~20% the total energy supply.

- Between 1800 and 2020, we reduced the labor needed to produce a kg of grain by more than 98% and we reduced the share of the country's population engaged in agriculture by the same large margin. This provides a useful gueide of the profound economic transformations that would have to take place with any retreat of agricultural mechanization and reduction in the use of synthetic agrochemicals.

- Half of the recent global crop harvests have been produced thanks to the application of synthetic nitrogenous compounds.

- The quest for mass-scale veganism is doomed to fail. Eating meat has been a significant a component of our evolutionary heritage as our large brains (which evolved partly becasue of meat eating). All our hominin ancestors were omnivorous, as are both species of chimpanzees which are closest to us in genetic makeup.

- A nearly perfect solution to our food problem would be to develop grain or oil crops with their roots hosting bacteria able to convert inert atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates.

- industrial man no longer eats potatoes made from solar energy; now he eats potatoes partly made of oil.

- Even if we try to change the global food system as fast as is realistically conceivable we will be eating transformed fossil fuels for decades to come.
