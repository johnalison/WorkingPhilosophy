## Caesar and Christ (Will Durant)

- Very good. Slow in places. Overly brief in others. Good foundation.

- The method of these volumes is synthetic history, which studies all the major phases of a peoples lifes, work, and culture in their simultaneous operation.

- We shall learn more of the nature of man by watching his behaviour through sixty centuries than by reading Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, and Kant.

- The study of antiquity is properly accounted worthless except as it may be made living drama or illuminate our contemporary life. The rise of Rome from a crossroads town to world mastery, its achievement of two centuries of security and peace from the Crimea to Gibraltar, and from the Euphrates to Hadrian's Wall, its spread of classic civilization over the Mediterranean and western European world, its struggle to preserve its ordered realm from a surrounding sea of barbarism, its long, slow crumbling and final catastrophic collapse into darkness and chaos -- this is surely the greatest drama ever played by man; unless it be that other drama which began when Caesar and Christ stood face to face in Pilate's court and continued until a handful of hunted Christians had grown by time and patience, and through persecution and terror, to be first the allies, then the masters, and at last the heirs, of the greatest empire in history.

- No other country has been so long the hub of history -- at first in government, then in religion, then in art. For seventeen hundred years, from Cato Censor to Michelangelo, Rome was the center of the Western world.

- The Etruscans are among the irritating obscurities of history. They ruled Rome for a hundred years or more, and left upon Roman ways so varied an influence that Rome can hardly be understood without them; yet Roman literature is as mute concerning them as a matron anxious to forget, publicly, the surrenders of her youth.

- Contentment is a rare among men as it is natual among animals, and no form of government has ever satisfied its subjects.

- By a pleasant custom the members of the Senate brought their sons with them to attend in silence, and to learn statesmanshop and chicanery at first hand.

- The Senate was at its worst in victory, at its best in defeat. It could carry forward policies that spanned generations and centruies; it could begin a war in 264 and end it in 146 BC.

- All dictators but two obeyed these restrictions (honoring how Cininnatus called from the plow to save the state (456 BC) returned to his farm as soon as the task was done. When this precedent was violated by Sulla and Caesar, the Republic passed back into the monarchy out of which it came.

- The Roman army conquered the world on a vegetarian diet.  The army of the republic lost battles, but it never lost a war.

- What astonishes us is that such a government could last so long (508 to 49 BC) and achieve so much. Perhaps it endured because of its muddling adaptability to change, and the proud patriotism formed in the home, the school, the temple, the army, the Assembly, and the Senate. Rome remained as great as long as she had enemies who forced her to unity, vision, and heroism. When she had overcome them all she florished for a moment and then began to die.

- The Second Punic War changed the face of the western Mediterranean.  It gave Spain and all its wealth to Rome, providing the funds for the Roman conquest of Greece. It reunited Italy under Romeâ€™s unquestioned mastery and threw open all routes and markets to Roman ships and goods. But it was the most costly of all ancient wars. It ravaged or injured half the farms of Italy, destroyed 400 towns, killed 300,000 men; southern Italy has never quite recovered from it to this day. It weakened democracy by showing that a popular assembly cannot wisely choose generals or direct a war. It began the transformation of Roman life and morals by hurting agriculture and helping trade; by taking men from the countryside and teaching them the violence of battle and the promiscuity of the camp; by bringing the precious metals of Spain to finance new luxuries and imperialistic expansion; and by enabling Italy to live on the extorted wheat of Spain, Sicily, and Africa. It was a pivotal event for almost every phase of Roman history. To Carthage it was the begining of the end.

- What increases with civilization is not so much immorality of intent as opportunity of expression.

- On the farm, children, like wives, were economic assets, not biological toys.

- Man placed an iron ring upon the fourth finger of the girls left hand, because it was believed that a nerve ran thence to her heart.

- Roman men became brave by proxy; they crowded the amphitheater to see bloody games, and hired gladiators to fight before them at their banquets.

- The principle of democracy is freedom, the principle of war is discipline; each requrires the absence of the other. War demands superior intelligence and courage, quick decisions, united action, immediate obedience; the frequency of war doomed democracy.

- Till Sulla, Roman history is a record of families rather than individuals.

- Greek culture triumphed in the rise of Constantinople as first the rival and then the successor of Rome; and when Constantinople fell, Greek literature, philosophy, and art reconquered Italy and Europe in the Renaissance. This is the central stream in the history of European civilization; all other currents are tributaries.

- Cato fought corruption recklessly, and seldom let the sun set without having made new enemies. Cato was the first great writer of Latin prose.

- The destruction of Carthage and Corinth in 146 BC must rank among the most brutal conquests in history.

- Rome had won everywar but the class war; and the destruction of Carthage removed the last check to civil division and strife. Now through a hundred bitter years of revolution Rome would pay the penalty of gaining the world.

- The causes of revolution were many, the reults were endless, the personalities thrown up by the crises, from the Gracchi to Augustus, were among the most powerful in history. Never before, and never again, until our time (WWII), were such stakes fought for, never was the world drama more intense.

- A distrubution of land among the poorer citizens seemed the obvious and necessary solution of three problems: rural slavery, urban congestion and corruption, and military decay.

- The Gracchi: More realisitic than Tiberius, Ciaus understood that no reform can endure which is opposed by the balance of economical or political power in the state.

- The city mob that Ciaus had befreinded made no protest when his corpse, and those of his followers, were flung into the river; it was busy plundering his house.

- Rome already recognized in Caesar's uncle (Giaus Marius) the uses of Caesar-ism; the dictatorshop of a popular leader backed by a devoted army seemed to many weary Romans the only alternative to the oligarchic abuses of liberty.

- Marius resorted to a new form or military enrollment, which revolutionized first the army and then the state. He invited enlistment of any citizen, property owner or not; offered attractive pay, and promissed to release volunteers, and give them lands, after a completed campaign.

- The Revolt of Italy: Marius emerged from his solitude, took command, and won victory after victory while all other Roman generals but Sulla met defeat. In three years of war 300k men fell, and central Italy was devastated.

- Sulla was unique in his origins, character and fate. Boor poor, he became the defender of the aristocracy, as the aristocratic Gcacchi, Drusi, and Caesar became leaders of the poor.

- Had his patience and insight equaled his ruthlessness and courage, Sulla might have saved Rome a half centrury of chaos and given her in 80 BC the peace and security, order and prosperity, that Augustus would bring back from Actium. He restored the old when he should have created the new. Under sulla, antiquity had never known so rich, so powerful, and so corrupt a government.

- Virtue lies not in the fear of the gods, nor in the timid shunning of pleasure; it lies in the harmonious operation of the senses and faculties guided by reason.  Some men wear out their lives for the sake of a statue and fame, but the real wealth of man is to live simply with a mind at peace"  - Lucretius

- For it is a nobler thinkg to enlarge the boundries of human intelligence than those of the Roman Empire. -- Cicero

- Cicero: Not since Plato had wisdom worn such prose.

- Age as well as youth has its glories -- a tolerant wisdom, the respectful attention of children, desire and ambition's fever cooled. Age may fear death, but not if the mind has been formed by philosophy. Beyond the grave there will be, at the best, a new and happier life; and at the worst there will be peace.

- When Cato, suspecting Caesar's complicity with Catiline, challenged him in the Senate to read aloud a note just brought to him, Caesar passed it to Cato without comment; it was a love letter from Cato's half sister.

- Caesars conquest of Gaul decided the character of French civilization. It added to the Roman Empire a country twice the size of Italy and opened the puses and markets of 5M people to Roman trade.  It saved Italy and the Mediterranean world for four centries from barbarian invasion.

- Cleopatra was a Macedonian Greak by origin, and more probably blonde than brunette.

- Caesar's transformation: The miracle whereby the youthful spendthrift and roisterer had become one of the ablest, bravest, fairest, and most enlightened men in all the sorry annals of politics.

- The assisination of Caesar was one of the major tragedies of history.

- Antony was one half of what Caesar had been, as Augustus would be the other half; Antony was a good general, Augustus a superlative statesman.

- Caesar's adopted son. Caius Octavius (later known as Augustus) was to make himself the greatest statesman in Roman history.

- Caesar's heir had conquered those of Alexander, and absorbed Alexander's realm; the West again, as at Marathon and Magnesia, had triumphed over the East.
