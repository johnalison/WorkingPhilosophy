## Caesar and Christ (Will Durant)

- Very good. Slow in places. Overly brief in others. Good foundation.

- The method of these volumes is synthetic history, which studies all the major phases of a peoples lifes, work, and culture in their simultaneous operation.

- We shall learn more of the nature of man by watching his behaviour through sixty centuries than by reading Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, and Kant.

- The study of antiquity is properly accounted worthless except as it may be made living drama or illuminate our contemporary life. The rise of Rome from a crossroads town to world mastery, its achievement of two centuries of security and peace from the Crimea to Gibraltar, and from the Euphrates to Hadrian's Wall, its spread of classic civilization over the Mediterranean and western European world, its struggle to preserve its ordered realm from a surrounding sea of barbarism, its long, slow crumbling and final catastrophic collapse into darkness and chaos -- this is surely the greatest drama ever played by man; unless it be that other drama which began when Caesar and Christ stood face to face in Pilate's court and continued until a handful of hunted Christians had grown by time and patience, and through persecution and terror, to be first the allies, then the masters, and at last the heirs, of the greatest empire in history.

- No other country has been so long the hub of history -- at first in government, then in religion, then in art. For seventeen hundred years, from Cato Censor to Michelangelo, Rome was the center of the Western world.

- The Etruscans are among the irritating obscurities of history. They ruled Rome for a hundred years or more, and left upon Roman ways so varied an influence that Rome can hardly be understood without them; yet Roman literature is as mute concerning them as a matron anxious to forget, publicly, the surrenders of her youth.

- Contentment is a rare among men as it is natual among animals, and no form of government has ever satisfied its subjects.

- By a pleasant custom the members of the Senate brought their sons with them to attend in silence, and to learn statesmanshop and chicanery at first hand.

- The Senate was at its worst in victory, at its best in defeat. It could carry forward policies that spanned generations and centruies; it could begin a war in 264 and end it in 146 BC.

- All dictators but two obeyed these restrictions (honoring how Cininnatus called from the plow to save the state (456 BC) returned to his farm as soon as the task was done. When this precedent was violated by Sulla and Caesar, the Republic passed back into the monarchy out of which it came.

- The Roman army conquered the world on a vegetarian diet.  The army of the republic lost battles, but it never lost a war.

- What astonishes us is that such a government could last so long (508 to 49 BC) and achieve so much. Perhaps it endured because of its muddling adaptability to change, and the proud patriotism formed in the home, the school, the temple, the army, the Assembly, and the Senate. Rome remained as great as long as she had enemies who forced her to unity, vision, and heroism. When she had overcome them all she florished for a moment and then began to die.

- The Second Punic War changed the face of the western Mediterranean.  It gave Spain and all its wealth to Rome, providing the funds for the Roman conquest of Greece. It reunited Italy under Romeâ€™s unquestioned mastery and threw open all routes and markets to Roman ships and goods. But it was the most costly of all ancient wars. It ravaged or injured half the farms of Italy, destroyed 400 towns, killed 300,000 men; southern Italy has never quite recovered from it to this day. It weakened democracy by showing that a popular assembly cannot wisely choose generals or direct a war. It began the transformation of Roman life and morals by hurting agriculture and helping trade; by taking men from the countryside and teaching them the violence of battle and the promiscuity of the camp; by bringing the precious metals of Spain to finance new luxuries and imperialistic expansion; and by enabling Italy to live on the extorted wheat of Spain, Sicily, and Africa. It was a pivotal event for almost every phase of Roman history. To Carthage it was the begining of the end.

- What increases with civilization is not so much immorality of intent as opportunity of expression.

- On the farm, children, like wives, were economic assets, not biological toys.

- Man placed an iron ring upon the fourth finger of the girls left hand, because it was believed that a nerve ran thence to her heart.

- Roman men became brave by proxy; they crowded the amphitheater to see bloody games, and hired gladiators to fight before them at their banquets.

- The principle of democracy is freedom, the principle of war is discipline; each requrires the absence of the other. War demands superior intelligence and courage, quick decisions, united action, immediate obedience; the frequency of war doomed democracy.

- Till Sulla, Roman history is a record of families rather than individuals.

- Greek culture triumphed in the rise of Constantinople as first the rival and then the successor of Rome; and when Constantinople fell, Greek literature, philosophy, and art reconquered Italy and Europe in the Renaissance. This is the central stream in the history of European civilization; all other currents are tributaries.
