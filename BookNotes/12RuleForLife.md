# 12 Rule for Life (Jordan Peterson)

- Decent overall.  Lot of repackaging of what Ive already heard on his podcast.

- In the West, we ahve been withdrawling from our tradion, religion, and even our nation centred-cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict.
  But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all.

- We must bear a load, to justify our miserable existence. We require routine and tradition.

- Animals who must co-habit with others in the same territories have learned many tricks to establish dominance, while risking the least amount of possible damage.

- If a dominant lobster is defeated its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate's brain -- one more appropriate to its new, lowly position.
  Its original brain just isnt sophisticated to manage the transformation from king to bottom dog without virtually complete dissolution and regrowth.

  Prozac even cheers up lobsters

  The part of our brain that keeps track of our position in the dominance hierarchy is therefore exceptionally ancient and fundamental.

- Order is the thin ice on which we all skate.

- We have twice as many female ancestors as male. (eg: imagine all the women who have ever lived have averaged on child. 1/2 the men have averaged 2 the other half 0)

- Human female choosiness is also why we are very different from the common ancestor we shared with our chompanzee cousins.

  Women's proclivity to say no, more than any other force, has shaped our evolution into the create, industrious, upright, large-brained (competitive, aggressive, domineering) creatures that we are.

- It is far better to render beings in your care competent than to protect them.

  Do you want to make your children safe or strong?

- When you have something to say, silence is a lie -- and tyranny feeds on lies.

- You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act.
  You simply dont know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself.

- Come be with us as soon as you can behave properly.

- Horror and terror lurk behind the walls provided so wisely by our ancestors. We tear them down at our peril.

- Disciplinary principles: 1) Limit the rules  2) use minimum necessary force 3) parents should come in pairs

- Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world.
  This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem.
  It is the primary duty of parents to make their children socially desirable.

- When first developing civilization our ancestors worked out very sophisticated solutions which we still dont understand very well.
  This is because they are in large part still implicit -- manifested primarily in ritual and myth and, incompletely articulated.
  We act them out and represent them in stories, but were not yet wise enough to formulate them explicitly.

- Our ancestors acted out a drama, a fiction: they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with, traded with, as if it were another human being.
  And the amazing thing is that it worked! This was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings -- often precisely those who have watched and evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behaviour. Its not very far from that to God, sitting above on high, tracking your every move and writting it down for further reference in a big book.

- The realization that pleasure could be usefully forestalled dawned on us with great difficultly. It runs absolutely contrary to our ancient, fundamental animal instincts, which demand  immediate satisfaction.
  To complicate matters, such delay only becomes useful when civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarentee the existence of the delayed reward.
