# The Discovery of Subatomic Partilces (Steven Weinberg)

- Great supplement to a Modern physics course.

- This book is written for readers who may not be familiar with classical physics, but who are willing to pick it up as they go along in order to understand the rich tangle of ideas and experiments that make up the history of 20C phyics

- The discoveries of science are among the most precious elements of 20C culture, it seems a tragedy that so many otherwise well-educated people are cut off from this part of culture by lack of familiarity with the basics of science. Generally the student or reader who wants to become literate in physics is offered only one path: he or she must follow the same time-honored sequence of courses followed by generationsof professional scientists.  My starting point in this book was the assumption that, whether or not readers enjoy calculating the collisions of billiard balls, they do generally want to have a cultural background in the revolutionary scientific ideas and discoveries of our time. Instead of starting with clasically physics, I invite the reader to plunge immediately into a sequence of key topics in 20C physics using each topic as an entree into just those concepts and methods of classical physics needed to understand that topic. The reader is asked to learn aspects of classical physics or chemistry ony when it has been made clear that these specific concepts and methods are needed to understand the progress of 20C physics.

- Most of what I know about physics and mathematics I have learned only when there was no alternative, when I simply had to learn something in order to get on with my own work. So the plan of this sort of book may be closer to the actual education of working scientists than many of the books and coursesa we design for students who specialize in science. My hope is that this book may contribute to a radical revision in the way science is brought to the non-scientist.

- How better can we understand the disolving of a piece of salt in a pot of water than by supposing that the atoms of which the salt is composed spread into the empty spaces between the atoms of water?
  How better can we understand the spread of a drop of oil on the sufrace of water, out to a definite area and no furthe, then by supposing that the oil spreads until it is a few atoms thick?

- Oddly the general acceptance of the atomic nature of matter came about through the discoveries of the constituents of the atom, the electron and atomic nucleus -- discoveries that undercut the old idea that atoms are indivisible.

- In Chemical, optical and electrical phenomena, the nucleus of the atom is essentially inert.

- Protons and neutrons in nuclei, like the electrons surrounding the nuclei, can be excited to states of higher energy or, if excited , can fall back to a state of lwer energy, but the energies needed to excite the nuclear partilces are typically a millions times those needed to excite electrons in the outer part of the atom.

- The special property that makes electrons, protons and neutrons ubiquitous ingredients of ordinary matter is their relative stability.
  These particles, elementary or not, will concern us in this book.

- There is one place with which the discovery of the constituents of the atom is especially associated : the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge.
  -) JJ Thomson performed the experiments on cathode rays that discovered the electron
  -) Rutherford began his work on radioactivity, was later the leader of the laboratory and estabilished it as the center for nuclear physics.
  -) Chadwick discovered the neutron

- Althought Maxwells work lent great prestige to teh Cavendish Professorship, the Laboratory did not develop into a leading center of experimental physics during his tenure.

- As a consequence of its lightness, charge and stability, the electron has a unique importance to physics, chemistry, and biology.

- JJ Thomson was not skillfull in the execution of experiments.
  His success was largely due to the use of better vacuum pumps, which lowered the pressure inside the cathode-ray tubes to the point where interactions with the residual gases became negligible.

- We still dont fully understand why when amber is rubbed with fur the electrons go from the fur to the amber or why when glass is rubbed with silk the electrons go from the glass to the silk.
  The socalled "Trobolectric" sequence is not well understood theoretically, and even a change in the weather can affect the relative  placement of those substances.

- How to remember anode vs cathode: cathode rays (electrons) come from the cathode and are attracted to the anode.

- The gram was orginially defined as the mass of a cubic centimeter of water.

- Ampere reached the conclusion that all magnetism is electromagnetism and that it is tiny electric currents circulating in the particles of a lodestone that give it its magnetic properties.
  This is the sort of unification that brings joy to the hearts of physicists.

- The discovery of electromagnetism had an immediate effect on technology. The powerful magnetics used in steel mills and particle accelerators are electromagnets. The application that probably had the greatest historical importance was the telegraph. Ampere saw at once, that the deflection of a compass needed can tell whethere a current has been switched on in a wire even if the switch is far away; so a meassage (reduced to a series of "on" and "offs") can be sent as far as teh wire will carry a sufficiently stron current.

- A problem that has been encountered oftern in physics: Energy is defined so taht it is conserved in some limited context and then in a larger context it is found not to be conserved.
  The response to this problem that has proved the most fruitful has been not to abandon the concept of energy, but to widen int to define new kinds of energy in such a way that the total value of all kines of energy is conserved.

- Zeemans measurements had provided a rought estimate of the mass-to-charge ratio of whatever it is that carries electric currents in atoms, Thomsons work on cathode rays showed that these charge carriers ar not just part of teh architecture of the atom, but have a separate existeence of their own outside the atom. Thus whatever what electons were, they contain at least one common constituent that is emitted from metals as cathode rays. The universality was soon verified when the beta rays were seen to be the same particles.

- Atoms in solids could be presumed to be packed closely together, so measurements of the densities of solid materials provided values for the densities of atoms.

- The mole is a useful unit because a mole of any substance always contains the same number of molecules.
