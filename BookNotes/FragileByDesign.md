# Fragile by Design (Charles Calomiris and Stephen Haber)

- Good. Learned a lot of history and a broad prospective on the purpose of banks.

- Banks are really an instuitutional embodiment (a mirror of sorts) of the political system that is a product of the societies deep history.
  (the banking system is not a product of moral failure of bankers)

- This book takes the view that politics that we see operating everywhere else around us also determine banking crises.
  Banking crises are not apolitical, or the result of unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances like natual disaters.

- a country does not "choose" its banking system: rather it gets a banking system that is consistent with the institutions that govern its distribution of political power.

- If bank crises were random events, all countries woudl suffer them with ~equal frequencies. The fact is that some countries have had many, while others have had few or none.
  The US is highly crises prone (14 crises over the past 180 years)
  Canada which shares a border and commom culture and language, had only two brief and mild bank illiquidity crises during the same period.

- Equally problematic are banking systems that provide too little credit relative to the size of the economy "under-banking"

- Until the mid 20C, the costs of failure tended to be borne by the bankers themselves, along with the shareholders and depositors. Since then, however, regulators and politicians come to impose these costs on taxpayers.  Why do taxpayers put up with bearing those costs?  Especially puzzling because shifting of losses onto taxpayers tends to produce much larger losses and deeper recessions than a system in which shareholders and depositors bear the cost. When shareholders and depositors have money at risk they impose discipline on the behaviour of the bankers.

- If stable and efficient banks are such a good idea, Why are they so rare?
  How can it be that a sector of the economy that is highly regulated adn closely supervised works so badly in so many countries ?
  Our answer is that the fragility of the banks and the scarcity of bank credit reflect the structure of a countries fundamental political institutions.

- The fact that the property-rights systems underpinning banking systems is an outcome of political deal making means that there are no fully private banking systems.
  Modern banking is best thought of as a partnership between the government and a group of bankers.

- Banks are regulated and supervised according to techinal criteria, and banking contracts are enforced according to abstruse laws, but those criteria and laws are not created and enforced by robots programmed to maximize social welfare; they are the outcomes of political processes -- a game -- whose stakes are wealth and power.

- It is rarely the case that a government chooses a fully "open-access" bank chartering system. Being selective about who gets to be a banker and deciding how much bankers are allowed to lend and to whom are crucial elements of the game.

- Our goal in this book is to explain this game. We seek to understand the process by which different rules emerge in different countries and how the players operate within those sets of rules.
  We show how differences in fundamental political institutions produce differences in the rules of the game, and how those politically based rules sometimes result predictably  in stable and plentiful bank credit, and sometimes in unstable and scare bank credit, and sometimes (as in the US) in unstable and plentiful bank credit.

- The idea taht banking systems can exist outside a system of government regulation is simply a libertarian fairy tale.

- Until very recently all US banks were prohibited from having branches in more than one state. Until the 1970s most US states had laws that prevented banks from opening multiple branches even within the state.

- The politics of regulatory approval for bank mergers set in motion a process wholes ultimate outcome was that large swaths of the American middle class were able to take advantage of mortgage underwritting rules that, compared to those of any other country in the world and of earlier periods in America's own history, were inconveivable lax.

- Financial markets have always been created and sustained by banks.

- A bank is, by design, a potentially unstable enterprise.

- This instability arises because the normal functioning of banks depends on three sets of property rights that only government can provide.

- There is no avoiding the government-bank partnership.

- What outputs does a bank produce ? and what inputs does it consume?
  The major outputs of a bank -- its products -- are debt contracts, primarily in the form of IOUs payable to the bank.
  The major inputs to the bank are also contracts, primarily in the form of IOS payable to depositors.
  The banks basic business model is therefore unusual: its input and outputs are both loans.

  Any enterprise whos inputs and outputs consist primarily of promises to repay debts in inherently unstable and risky.
  Bankers must engange in a difficult balancing act. They cannot predict with certianty that the debtor will repay the loan.
  It is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, for bankers to exactly match the durations of their contracts with depositors and debtors.

- The bank insiders need outsiders to invest their wealth in the bank in order to make the bank stable enough to attract depositors, but in doing so the insiders transfer the rist from depositors to equity investors.
