# The Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)

- Very good.  Too aggressive Austrian vs Keynes at times. First time I learned the differences. Would like to see a rebuttal.

- A problem that has existed for all of humanities existence: How to move economic value across time and space.

- A good that assumes the role of a widely accepted medium of exchange is called money.
  - It is primarily used for the sake of being exchanged for other goods.

- Salability - the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder desires.

- There is no need for a government to impose the hardest money on society; society will have uncovered it long before it concocted its government.

- Money also serves as a unit of account: a metric with which to measure interpersonal value.

- Historically different media served the function of money during a period which it had one of the best stock-to-flow ratios available to its population, but stopped when it lost that property.

- gold is so chemically stable that it is virtually impossible to destroy; gold is impossible to synthesize from other materials and can only be extracted from its unrefined ore, which is extremely rare on our planet.

- Silver may maintain its sporting connection for second place, but with notes that allow payments without having to move the monetary unit itself, second place in monetary competition is equivalent to losing out.

- It should be of interest to modern Keynesians economists, that although the emperors of Rome frantically tried to "manage" their economies, they only succeeded in making matters worse.

- Florence 1252 minted the florin, the first major European sound coinage since Julius Caesar's aureus.

- Britain was the first to adopt a modern gold standard in 1717, under the direction of Isaac Newton. Britain would remain under a gold standard until 1914 (although it not during the Napoleonic wars)

- Claim: the failure of China and India to catch up to the West during the 20C is linked to the destruction of wealth and capital brought about by the demonetization of silver used in these countries.

- History shows that it is not possible to insulate yourself from the consequences of others holding money that is harder than yours.

- The gold standard had its flaws, governments and banks were always creating media of exchange (notes/checks) beyond the quantity of gold in their reserves. Fatal flaw of the gold standard was that settlement in physical gold is cumbersome, expensive, and insecure,  which meant that it had to rely on centralizing physical gold reserves in a few locations -- leaving them vulnerable to being taken over by governments.

- The network of gold settlement used by banks became valuable enough that its owners credit was effectively monetized. As the ability to run a bank started to imply money creation, governments gravitated to taking over the banking sector through central banking.

- Even as central banks repeatedly declare the end of golds monetary role, their actions in maintaining their gold reserves ring truer.

- WWI saw the end of the era of monetary media being the choice decided by the free market, and the beginning of the era of government money.

- No fiat money has come into circulation solely through government fiat; they were all originally redeemable in gold or silver, or currencies that were redeemable in gold and silver.

- No pure fiat currency exists in circulation without any form of backing.

- When comparing different national currencies, we find that the major and most widely used currencies have a lower annual increase in their supply.

- The major difference between WWI and the previous limited war was neither geopolitical nor strategic, but rather monetary.

- With the simple suspension of gold redeemability, governments' war efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their own treasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population.  A sovereign now had access to its people accumulated wealth expropriated through inflation.

- Academic economics stopped being an intellectual discipline focused on understanding human choices under scarcity and instead became an arm of the government.

- The conclusion obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of money and economics is that the cause of the Great Crash of 1929 was the diversion away from the gold standard in the post-WWI years, and the deepening of the Depression was caused by government control and socialization of the economy in the Hoover and FDR years. Neither the suspension of the gold standard nor the wartime spending did anything to alleviate the Great Depression.

- In the presence of fiat money to finance government, political differences between parties disappear as politics no longer contains trade-offs and every candidate can champion every cause.

- Hyperinflation is a form of economic disaster unique to government money. There was never an example of hyperinflation with economies that operated a gold or silver standard.

- The problem with government money is that its hardness depends entirely on the ability of those in charge to not inflate its supply. Only political constraints provide hardness, and there are no physical, economic, or natural constraints on how much money government can produce.

- Everyday a person will conduct a few economic transactions with other people, but they will partake in a far larger number of transactions with their future self. A mans lot in life will largely be determined by these these trades between him and his future self.
