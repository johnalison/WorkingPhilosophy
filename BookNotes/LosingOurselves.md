# Losing Ourselves (Jay Garfield)

- Very good! Transformed my thinking about the self and about free will!

- The book argues explicitly for a position that many think flies in the face of common sense "That we are not selves", nor do we have selves. I will not argue that we do not exist. (That would be madness) But I will argue that we exist not as selves, but as persons.

- too often what masquerades as common sense is in fact nonsense. Any philosophical program that takes our commonsense intuitions for granted, and then takes as its task to defend them by elucidating them, or making them more precise, may simply ramify confusion instead of generating clarity.

- Many people take thamese3lves to eb selves and not persons in the relevant sense and that are wrong to do so.

- Candrakirti was distinctive in his defense both of the robust reality of the world we inhabit, and of the view that despite -- or more accurately because of -- the fact that it is real, our own existence and that of the objects and institutions that surround is merely conventional, dependent upon the way we think and the way we talk.

- David Hume argued that we must take the reality of the world around us for granted; he also argued that we are systematically confused if we take our own existence, and that of the world around us, to be prior to and independent of our conventions -- our ways of acting, talking and thinking.

- My aim is to develop andto defend the idea of personhood on its own terms in the absence of any self, and to explore its ramifications.

- I believe that the illusion that we are selves undermines ethical cultivation and moral vision, and that coming to understand ourselves as persons facilitates a more salutary, mature moral engagement with those around us.

- Once we recognize that a conception or commitment is causing us problems, it is often easier and more tempting to confuse it with another idea, to refute the other idea, and to leave the problematic conception in place.

- Although the majority of this book in concerned with investigating the illusion of the self, in the end it is really a book about ethics.

- The first thing we must do is identify what this self is supposed to be. We thereby ensure that our analyses are directed at the correct target.

- Atman: The idea that the atman lies at the core of our being is ubiquitous in orthodox Indian philosophy, and was a principal target of Buddhist critique. In the Vedas, particularly Upanisads, it is characterized as unitary, as the witness of all that we perceive, as the agent of our actions, and as the enjoyer of our aesthetic experience. It is regarded as that which is always the subject, never the object; and as that which persists through life despite changes in body and mind, and which even persists beyond death.

- The supposed relation between the self and the embodied person as akin to that between you and your wardrobe.  You, the atman, put on a new mind and body in each life, but are never identical to any mind or body; instead you are the bearer of that mind and body, which are just as much objectws ot your subjectivity as any external phenomenon.

- The self is argued to be necessary in order to explain sensory integration. They also argue that the self is necessary in order to explain the possibility of memory.

- Any no-self position, must assume the burden of explaining both the apparent integration of consciousness at each moment and our preceived identity over time in the absence of a unitary subject and agent.

- A person is a socially embedded human being with no self.

- (In a Christian context) The soul (or psyche) is help to be distinct from and to be the possessor of the mind and body; the subject of knowledge; the agent of action; the object of moral approbation or disapprobation; and the enjoyer or sufferer of reward and punishment.

- St Augustine also argues that the psyche is immediately available to us in introspection and that it has the distincitive property of freedom, of exemption from causation in its active role, a property he deems nesessary for moral responsibility.

- You might think that the idea that our existance involves the reality of a self emerges in diverse traditions is evidence for its correctness. This ubiquity is in fact evidence for a kind of innate tendency to succumb to a particular cognitive illusion.

- The word person denotes the complex, constructed, socially embedded psychophysical complexes.
