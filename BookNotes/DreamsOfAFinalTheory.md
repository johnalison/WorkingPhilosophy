# Dreams of a Final Theory (Steven Weinberg)

- Very good. A lot of my particle intro/PGSS lectures are based off of this book (Although I think I got them from his other work)

- Arrows of science.

- our science is ABOUT the discovery of explanation built into the logical structure of nature.

- The 20C for a physicist begins in 1895 with the discovery of X-ray. Not so much b/c they were important in and of themselves, but because they encouraged physicists to believe that there was much more to be discovered.

- Chalk, calcium carbonate consists of countless fossile shells of tiny animals that lived in ancient seas.
    - Chalk strongly absorbs in the UV and IR, not the visible. Light reflected from chalk has pretty much the same distribution of visible wavelengths as the light that illuminates it. THis is why chalks (or snow, clouds) are white.

- Its not clear if the universial and the historical elements of science will forever remain distinct. It is possible that eventually the initial conditions will appear as part of the universal laws.
  (The reverse may also be thie case, that what we think of as universal laws may be from historical accidents.)

- The principles of thermodynamics could be deduced mathematically by an analyisis of the probabilities of different configurations of the system.
  Thermodynamics is more like a mode of reasoning than a body of universal law. We can use the same techinques where ever it applies. But the justification of why it applies must be based elsewhere.
  In terms of the image of arrows of explanation, thermodynamics is like a certian pattern that gets repeated again and again in very different contexts.
  The fact that a theory finds applications in a wide variety of phenomena does not imply that it is autonomous from deeper physical laws (emergence deepends on the deeper physics)

- "It is not unreasonable to hope that when the objective correlatives to consciousness have been explained, somewhere in our explainations will be something that that we recognize something that corresponds to our experince of consciousness itself. 

- Something is real when the thing must be taken seriously b/c it can affect us in ways that are not entirely in our control and b/c we cannot learn about it without making an effort that goes beyond our own imagination.

- One of the great services of the tapestry of arrows of scientific explanation is to show that there are no autonomous sciences (eg: atrology /telekinesis).
  - B/c there is no time to test everything we should focus on the unknowns that are scientifically plausible. Our greatest aid is the pattern of scientific explanation.

- Reductionism is a sense of hierarchy. It is not a guideline for a research program, but an attitude toward nature. The perception that scientific principles are the way they are b/c of deeper scientific principles (and historical accidents) and all principles can be traced to one simple set of connected laws.

- Elementary physics is more fundamental not because it is mathematically more profound or more useful in other fields but only that it is closer to the point of convergence of all our arrows of explanation.

- Example of why elementary particle physics more fundamental (high-tempature super-conductivity vs electro-weak symmetry breaking). Condensed matter and high-energy physicsts will ultimately solve these problems, when they do we will find that high-T super-conductivity is ultimately explained in terms of KNOWN properties of electrons photons and nuclei. However electro-weak symmetry breaking will NOT be explained in terms of other known entities in the Standard Model.

- The study of quarks and electrons is interesting not b/c everyday matter is made of them, but b/c studying them will cause us to learn something about the principles of physics. Actually often exotic particples can be more interesting to HEP. At this moment in science studying particles is the way to make the most progress toward the final theory.

- Everyone is really a reductionist.  IF a new cure for a disease were suggested by experince with many patients, it would not be fully accepted if we could not see how it could possibly be explained reductively in terms of biochemistry and cell biology.  The reductionist attitude provides a useful filter that saves scientists in all fields from wasting time on ideas that are not worth pursuing.
