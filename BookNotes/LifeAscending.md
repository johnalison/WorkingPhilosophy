# Life Ascending (Nick Lane)

- Fantastic! Another new favorite author. Great big picture overviews of biology with a chemists perspective. 

- Life itself turned our planet blue and gree. Photosynthetic bacterial cleansed the air and sea and filled them with oxygen. This new and potent source of energy powered larger life forms.

- Until recently there have been two paths into the past: fossils and genes. Both have their pros and cons. There are now powerful methods that go beyond these and this book is in part a celebration of them.

- Its a joy to be alive at this time, when we already know so much, and yet still look forward to so much more.

- Life emerged 3.8 billion years ago. Bacteria dominated our planet for 2.5 billion years before the first complex organisms appeared.

- Chemistry => that life had to emerge quickly. Chemical reations must happen rapidly or not at all. If a reaction takes 1000 years then the reactants will simply dissipate unless they are continually replenished by other faster reactions.

- The origin of life is not the great mystery that it is sometimes made out to be. Life emerges, perhaps almost enevitably from the turning of the globe.

- Miller-Urey experiment, amino acids forming is "primordial soup" after electrifying a simple mixture of gases.
  Over time this has fallen out of favor. Ancient rocks make it clear that the earth never was rich in methane, ammonia and hydrogen.
  The soup idea was rescued by the detection of abundant organic molecules in space (comets and meteorites)


- The origin of life is the origin of replication.  A corpse cant be brough back to life by electrocuting it repeatedly.

- The molecules in food want very much to react with oxygen. The slow-burning combustion that sustains us all, is when hydrogen stripped from food reacts with the oxygen to release all the energy we need to live.  This is the real problem with the soup. it is themodynamically flat. Nothing in the soup really wants to react. There is no disequilibrium, no driving force.

- Population densities in the the deep-sea vents rival a rainforest despite being powered by the vent exhast rather than the sun.

- Sulphur bacteria can extract hydrogen from the vents and attach it to carbon dioxide to form organic matter, this costs energy; to provides it, the bacteria need oxygen. The raction of hydrogen sulphide with oxygen releases the energy that powers the vent world (equivalent to the reation of hydrogen with oxygen that powers ours) Only bacteria living right next to the vents, drawing fomr both worlds can pull off these reactions.

- The volcanism of our planet os largely driven by a continuous flow of seawater throught the mantle. Its what keeps our world out of equilibrium. Its the turning of our world.

- All life on earth share common properties: composed of cells, have genes made of DNA, all encode proteins via a universal code of particular amino acids. All living things share a common energy currency ATP. All life shares common core of metabolic reactions known as the Krebs cycle. Normally this cycle comsumes organic molecules (food) and pins off hydrogen (which will then be burned with oxygen) and carbon dioxide.

- Acids are defined in terms of protons: an acid is rich in protons and alkali (base) poor.

- The common ancestor of all life on earth was not a free-living cell but a rocky labyrinth of mineral calls, lined with catalytic walls composed of iron, sulphor and nickel and energised by proton gradients. The first life was a porous rock that generated complex molecules and energy right up to the formation of proteins and DNA itself.  ( Life could not leave the vents until it had learned to harness its own chemiosmotic (the movement of protons over a membrane) gradient, but it could only harness its own gradient using genes and DNA. Life must have evolved a surprising degree of sophistication in its rocky hatchery.)

- There are 3e9 letters (base pairs) in the human genome. "3 gigabases"  The human body has 15 million million cells ~ 1.5e13. Error rate of transcription of 1e-9.

- DNA morphs and twists, selection straightens

- Assuming that humans split off from chimps 6e6 years ago, and accumulated mutations at a rate of 200 per generation ever since, we would only have time to modify 1% of the genome.

- Deciphering the code of life was a larger achievement than in determining the double helix.  The deciphered code was initially the most puzzling disappointment in modern biology, gives intriguing insights into how the DNA evolved in the first place.

- Genes code for proteins. DNA makes RNA, RNA makes proteins, Proteins are composed of a succession of building blocks called amino acids. Presumably, the sequence of letters in DNA endoded the sequence of amonio acids in proteins. Four different letters in DNA had to code for 20 amino acids. The actual code is degenerate, not an elegant solution! Three amino acids are coded by as many as six different codons, others by only one or two. This is theperfect antidote to the idea that beauty is any guide to truth in science. (Crick declared disappointing code as a "frozen accident")  We have now come to realize that the code is neither frozen nor accidental. We now know that it is a "one in a million" able to resist change and speed up the pace of evolution at once. The real genetic code is startlingly resistant to change.  B/c it looks designed, it must have evolved. But how can the code change without causing mayhem?

- There is a code within the codons which implies a physical process that could be stably optimized.

- the common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was not a free-living organism at all, but a replictor of sorts, confined to porous rock.

- Chlorophyll turns light from the sun into chemical energy.

- Without photosynthesis there would be no free oxygen. There might not be oceans, without oxygen there is not ozone which block UV rays. UV rays split water into oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen evoporates.

- Mars is dead. it is in near-perfect equilibrium.

- All animal and plants depend on oxygen. Life, in a world without free oxygen, is microscopic.

- All the oxygen put into the air by photosyntheisis (co2-> c + o2) is taken out by respiration (o2 + c (food) -> co2). The only way that a planet can gain an oxygen atmosphere is if plant matter is preserved intact... it must be buried. Preserved plant matter is buried as coal, oil, natural gas, soot, charcoal in rocks deep in the earth. There is ~25k times more dead organic carbn trapped in the earth than living in the biosphere; the vast majority of organic carbon is buried as microscopic detritus in rocks like shales, inaccessible to human industry.

- There was an unprecedented rate of carbon burial in the Carboniferous era.

- From 2B to 1B years ago ("the boring billion") almost nothing of note happened.

- Oxygen liberated by photosynthesis comes from water, not co2. (This is the first step to solving the energy and climate crisis)

- Solar energy splits water into H and O2. Photosynthesis can do this (we havent figured it how to yet) with gentle sunlight rather than UV rays.
  We when figure out how to do it we will solve the worlds energy crisis; water is the most ubiquitous and raw material on our planet.

- Photosynthesis is conceptually simple: its all about electrons. Add a few  electrons to CO2, along with a few protons to balance out charges and you get a sugar. Sugars are the ultimate source of all our food. Cyanobacteria split H2o to get the the electrons. Water is very stable: it has a high affinity for its electrons.
