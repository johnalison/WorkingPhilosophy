# Life Ascending (Nick Lane)

- Fantastic! Another new favorite author. Great big picture overviews of biology with a chemists perspective. 

- Life itself turned our planet blue and gree. Photosynthetic bacterial cleansed the air and sea and filled them with oxygen. This new and potent source of energy powered larger life forms.

- Until recently there have been two paths into the past: fossils and genes. Both have their pros and cons. There are now powerful methods that go beyond these and this book is in part a celebration of them.

- Its a joy to be alive at this time, when we already know so much, and yet still look forward to so much more.

- Life emerged 3.8 trillion years ago.
