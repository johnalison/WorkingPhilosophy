# The Mind Illuminated (Culadasa)

- Great guide!

- There is supprisingly little infomation about how the mind works and how to trian it. This book is an attemt to fill that need

- Meditation is the systematic process of training the mind.  For your presonal reality to be created purposefully rather than haphazardly, you must understand your mind and develop a deep intuitive understanding.

- This book explains what skills you need to cultivate, in what order, and how to go about doing it. This is a major stumbling block for many meditators.
  Teaching by stages is an easy and effective way to reach the highest goals.  Unfortunatly many excellent maps lie hidden in the literatures of various Buddhist traditions.
  The modern roadmap offered in this book combines experience, tradition and science.

- The five most important Insights are: impermanence, emptiness, the nature of suffering, the causal interdependence of all phenomenon, and the illusion of the separate self.

- To get insight you need stable attention and mindfulness. (stable attention without mindfulness only leads to blissful dullness)

- Stable attention + mindfulness + insight leads to Awakening. Awakening is an accident, but continued practice makes you accident prone. 

- Distinction made between attention and awareness
  Supported by cognitive psycology and neuroscience

- Reread "An overview of the Ten stages" when you are unsure where you are heading.

- Isolated meditation experiences can happen at any time, but if they cant be repeated, consistently and intentionally they are of little use.

- For householders who practice properly it is possible to master the Ten stages within a few months or years. What you need is a daily practice of 1 to 2 hours per day in combinaiton with supplemental practices described in the appendix.

- If the skills and insights we learn on the cushion dont infiltrate our daily lives, progressw will be quite slow.

- The most important factor for improving quickly is a clear understanding of each Stage: recognize the mental faculties you need to cultivate, adn the methods to overcome specific obstacles.

- The untrained mind produces distractions that lead to forgetting that results in mind-wandering.

- All we are doing in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention. Intentions lead to mental actions, and repeated mental actions become mental habits.

- The two major objectives to meditation practice are stable attention and mindfulness.

- We have two forms of conscious experience: attention and peripheral awareness. Attention dominates our conscious experience, but through awareness we are generally aware of things in the background.
  (Similar to relationship between visual focus and peripheral vision)
  Two different ways of knowing the world.

- Starting your practice:
  -) Relax your mind, take some moments to appreciate the fact that you're gifting yourself the time to do this.
  -) Resolve to practice diligently for the whole session.
  -) Allow your attention to stay centered on your meditation object while your peripheral awareness remains relaxed and open to anything that arises
  -) As soon as you recognize that you have become distracted and have drifted away, take a momment to appreciate the fact that you have remember to meditate and give yourself a pat on the back
  -) Repeate

- Sustaining attention is harder than directing it. It is possible to voluntarily direct attention, however the part of the mind that sustains attention for more than a few moments works unconsciously.

- Just by intending to observe an object and coming back to it when we get distracted, we're training that unconscious process to help us stay focused more continuously.
  Formulating the conscious intention to focus on the meditation objects gives a new piece of information for unconscious processes to take into account.

- Skillfully applying conscious intention can completely restructure the mind and transforme who we are. The is the essensce of meditation: we reprogram unconscious mental processes by repeating basic tasks over and over with a clear intention.

- Mindfulness is the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness. It allows us to recognize our options and choose our responses wisely.

- Attention turns its objects into concepts or abstract ideas. Peripheral awareness is only minimally conceptual, it is concerned with the relationship among objects and to the whole.

- Attention analyzes our experience and peripheral awareness provides the context.

- Attention is self-centered.  Uses the filter of self-interest.

- Peripheral awareness can observe the overall state of mind.

- Who we are and how we behave, everything we think, feel, say, ect - depends on the interaction between awareness and attention. Mindfulness is the optimal interaction between the two.

- Move of us have never learned to use peripheral awareness effectively.  They overuse attention because its under direct conscious control whereas peripheral awareness isnt.  In meditation, where other distractions are minimized, we can learn to use peripheral awareness effectively, and become skilled at using the two together.

- Making your conscious more poweful is like weight training, where you practice sustaining close attention and strong peripheral awareness AT THE SAME TIME.

- When you have cultivated mindfulness, life becomes richer, more vivid, and more satisfying and you wont take everything that happens so personally. You become more objective and clearheaded adn develop an enhanced awareness of the whole.
