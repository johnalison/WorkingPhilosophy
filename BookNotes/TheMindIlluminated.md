# The Mind Illuminated (Culadasa)

- Great guide!

- There is supprisingly little infomation about how the mind works and how to trian it. This book is an attemt to fill that need

- Meditation is the systematic process of training the mind.  For your presonal reality to be created purposefully rather than haphazardly, you must understand your mind and develop a deep intuitive understanding.

- This book explains what skills you need to cultivate, in what order, and how to go about doing it. This is a major stumbling block for many meditators.
  Teaching by stages is an easy and effective way to reach the highest goals.  Unfortunatly many excellent maps lie hidden in the literatures of various Buddhist traditions.
  The modern roadmap offered in this book combines experience, tradition and science.

- The five most important Insights are: impermanence, emptiness, the nature of suffering, the causal interdependence of all phenomenon, and the illusion of the separate self.

- To get insight you need stable attention and mindfulness. (stable attention without mindfulness only leads to blissful dullness)

- Stable attention + mindfulness + insight leads to Awakening. Awakening is an accident, but continued practice makes you accident prone. 

- Distinction made between attention and awareness
  Supported by cognitive psycology and neuroscience

- Reread "An overview of the Ten stages" when you are unsure where you are heading.

- Isolated meditation experiences can happen at any time, but if they cant be repeated, consistently and intentionally they are of little use.

- For householders who practice properly it is possible to master the Ten stages within a few months or years. What you need is a daily practice of 1 to 2 hours per day in combinaiton with supplemental practices described in the appendix.

- If the skills and insights we learn on the cushion dont infiltrate our daily lives, progressw will be quite slow.

- The most important factor for improving quickly is a clear understanding of each Stage: recognize the mental faculties you need to cultivate, adn the methods to overcome specific obstacles.

- The untrained mind produces distractions that lead to forgetting that results in mind-wandering.

- All we are doing in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention. Intentions lead to mental actions, and repeated mental actions become mental habits.

- The two major objectives to meditation practice are stable attention and mindfulness.

- We have two forms of conscious experience: attention and peripheral awareness. Attention dominates our conscious experience, but through awareness we are generally aware of things in the background.
  (Similar to relationship between visual focus and peripheral vision)
  Two different ways of knowing the world.

- Starting your practice:
  -) Relax your mind, take some moments to appreciate the fact that you're gifting yourself the time to do this.
  -) Resolve to practice diligently for the whole session.
  -) Allow your attention to stay centered on your meditation object while your peripheral awareness remains relaxed and open to anything that arises
  -) As soon as you recognize that you have become distracted and have drifted away, take a momment to appreciate the fact that you have remember to meditate and give yourself a pat on the back
  -) Repeate

- Sustaining attention is harder than directing it. It is possible to voluntarily direct attention, however the part of the mind that sustains attention for more than a few moments works unconsciously.

- Just by intending to observe an object and coming back to it when we get distracted, we're training that unconscious process to help us stay focused more continuously.
  Formulating the conscious intention to focus on the meditation objects gives a new piece of information for unconscious processes to take into account.

- Skillfully applying conscious intention can completely restructure the mind and transforme who we are. The is the essensce of meditation: we reprogram unconscious mental processes by repeating basic tasks over and over with a clear intention.

- Mindfulness is the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness. It allows us to recognize our options and choose our responses wisely.

- Attention turns its objects into concepts or abstract ideas. Peripheral awareness is only minimally conceptual, it is concerned with the relationship among objects and to the whole.

- Attention analyzes our experience and peripheral awareness provides the context.

- Attention is self-centered.  Uses the filter of self-interest.

- Peripheral awareness can observe the overall state of mind.

- Who we are and how we behave, everything we think, feel, say, ect - depends on the interaction between awareness and attention. Mindfulness is the optimal interaction between the two.

- Move of us have never learned to use peripheral awareness effectively.  They overuse attention because its under direct conscious control whereas peripheral awareness isnt.  In meditation, where other distractions are minimized, we can learn to use peripheral awareness effectively, and become skilled at using the two together.

- Making your conscious more poweful is like weight training, where you practice sustaining close attention and strong peripheral awareness AT THE SAME TIME.

- When you have cultivated mindfulness, life becomes richer, more vivid, and more satisfying and you wont take everything that happens so personally. You become more objective and clearheaded adn develop an enhanced awareness of the whole. 

- Stage One: Establishing a Practice
  - The goal for stage one is to develop a regular meditation practice
  - When your intention is strong and clear the appropriate actions naturally follow
  - The basic practice used in this book is simple: direct your attentino to a well-defined meditation object. Whenever you attention wanders, redirect it back. Repeat.
  - Diligence means engaging wholeheartedly in the practice rather than spending you time thinking of something else.
  - Step One: Focus on the present. The only limitation you make on movements of attention is to remain here, now in the present. Disregard any thought not related to the present
  - Mindfully observing thoughts is tricky, better to focus on sounds, smells and sensations.
  - Let it come, let it be, let it go.
  - Step Two: Focus on Bodily sensations: Whenever you notice your attention going to sound or thought bring it back to the body. Notice any plesant sensations; spend a few minutes enjoying the sensations.
  - Repeat this as often as needed until the mind can rest easily with your attention focused only on bodily sensations. No need to hurry to the next step.
  - Step Three: Focus on the bodily sensations associated to the breath: Without suppressing anything in your field of conscious awareness restrict your attention to breath-related sensations.
  - Step Four: Focus on the breath at the nose: Aim is to tame the constant movements of attention, while at the same time, maintaining peripheral awareness of things in the background
  - Counting your breaths at the start of the session helps to stabilize your attention
  - Once you have moved through the four steps, count you breaths at the nose. Goal: to follow continuously for 10 consecutive breaths.
    	 (For now, continuous = aware of both inhale and exhale and didnt loose count)
  - Conisder the beginning of the out-breath as the start of the cycle.
  - Stop counting (but keep observing the breath!) after 10
  - If your mind wanders for a long time, dont immediatelhy return to the breath at the nose. Go back to step 2, focus on bodily sensations, then steop 3 and then come back to the nose.
  - Counting is important no matter where you are on the path: it will give you valuable information on your state of mind and the distractions you're most likely to face.
  - Emphasize relaxation, peacefulness and pleasure over willpower and effort.
  - Once seated, you must train yourself gently and without self-judgement, to actually meditate rather than engage in some more entertaining mental activity.
  - The real solution to obstacles is to enjoy your practice. A simple and powerful techinque is to intentionally savor all feelings of physicsal comfort and diliberatelycultivate the pleasure that can be found in the quietness
  - Ideally, you shoudl meditate at the same time everyday. Strongly recommend at least one daily 45 min sit.
  - Let go of expectations and generate an attitude of faith, trust and confidence: faith in the method, trust that the results will come with continued practice, and confidence in your own ability.
  - Joyful effort and diligence are the right attitude. Rather than striving focus on the pleasant, positive elements of each session, joyfully repeating the same simple tasks as many times as needed to acheive the goal.
  - Mastered stage one when you rarely if ever procrastinate on the cushion by thinking and planning or doing something besides meditating.

- All the mental skills needed in meditation are innate abilities we can selectively choose to cultivate.

- Meditation is like mental exercise that train "mental muscles"

- The capacities that we develop and use in meditation are comletely natural and normal, however, so too are the activities of the mind that can hinder our practice.
  In daily life, these hinderences serve necessary and useful purposes.

- There are five hinderences to overcome:  Worldy desire, Aversion, Laziness and Lethargy, Agitation due to worry and remorse, and Doubt.
  These hinderences are evolutionary adaptations for improving survival + reproduction. 

- To overcome them we need positive reinforcement of other natural tendencies of the mind. suppression or self-punishment will not work.

- When we behave virtuously we dont create further causes for Remorse or Worry.

- Virtue is the practice of inner purification, which RESULTS in good behavior.

- Doubt is like a perverse faith in failure that saps our will and undermines our intentions.
  The remedy is to envision the possibility of long-term success.

- Meditation is about attention and awareness.

- The antidote to the Monkey-mind is to get grounded in the body.

- Insight: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional

- The five hinderences are more than just obstacles to meditation. They are the same obstacles that thwart a happy, productive existence.

- Stage Two: Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering
  - The goal for stage two is to shorten the periods of mind-wandering and extend the periods of sustained attention to the meditation object.
  - Willpower cant pervent you from forgetting the breath, nor can you force yourself to become aware that the mind is wandering.
  - Instead, just hold the intention to appreciate the "aha" moment that recognizes mind-wandering, while gently but firmly redirecting attention back to the breath.
  - You've mastered this Stage when episoes of mind-wandering are brief, while you attention to the breath last much longer.
  - The combined problems of forgetting and mind-wandering will dominate your sessions in Stage Two
  - Forgetting means we forget the meditation object.
  - Mind-wandering is what happens after we've forgotten what we were doing: the mind will wander from thought to thought, often for a long time, before we "wake up" to what is happening.
  - Selection pressures have favored spontaneously moving attention more strongly than stable attention.
  - Our natural tendency when we catch ourselves mind-wandering is to quickly return to the breath, often forcely and with self-judgment. This misses a key oppirtunity for training the mind.
  - Use the "aha" moment of realizing that theres a disconnect between what you doing, and what you intended to do. 
  - The process that discovered the "aha" moment isnt under you conscious control
  - The way to overcome mind-wandering is to train this unconscious process to make the discovery and bring it into consciousness sooner and more often. Do this by taking a moment to take a moment to enjoy and appreciate "waking up". Savor the sense of being more fully conscious and present.  Conscious intention and affirmation powerfully influence our unconscious processes.
  - Avoid becoming annoyed or self-critical about mind-wandering. 
  - Dont try to limit peripheral awareness.
  - "You" are not in control of "Your" mind. Mind wandering happens constantly. we rarely notice it, which leads us to believe that we are in constant control. 
  - The mind is a collective of mental processes operating through consensus, or through temporary dominance of one over the others.
  - The basic rule for meditation is that you always intentionally select the locus of attention.
  - The best way to avoid or resolve inpatients is to enjoy your practice.
  - Sucess come with repetition with a relaxed attitude, rather than effortful striving.
  - "Relax and look for the joy; observe; let it come, let it be, let it go. Recite it every time you sit.
  - You have mastered this stage when you can consistently maintain your focus on the meditation object for minutes, while mind-wandering lasts only seconds.
