# The Mind Illuminated (Culadasa)

- Great guide!

- There is supprisingly little infomation about how the mind works and how to trian it. This book is an attemt to fill that need

- Meditation is the systematic process of training the mind.  For your presonal reality to be created purposefully rather than haphazardly, you must understand your mind and develop a deep intuitive understanding.

- This book explains what skills you need to cultivate, in what order, and how to go about doing it. This is a major stumbling block for many meditators.
  Teaching by stages is an easy and effective way to reach the highest goals.  Unfortunatly many excellent maps lie hidden in the literatures of various Buddhist traditions.
  The modern roadmap offered in this book combines experience, tradition and science.

- The five most important Insights are: impermanence, emptiness, the nature of suffering, the causal interdependence of all phenomenon, and the illusion of the separate self.

- To get insight you need stable attention and mindfulness. (stable attention without mindfulness only leads to blissful dullness)

- Stable attention + mindfulness + insight leads to Awakening. Awakening is an accident, but continued practice makes you accident prone. 

- Distinction made between attention and awareness
  Supported by cognitive psycology and neuroscience

- Reread "An overview of the Ten stages" when you are unsure where you are heading.

- Isolated meditation experiences can happen at any time, but if they cant be repeated, consistently and intentionally they are of little use.

- For householders who practice properly it is possible to master the Ten stages within a few months or years. What you need is a daily practice of 1 to 2 hours per day in combinaiton with supplemental practices described in the appendix.

- If the skills and insights we learn on the cushion dont infiltrate our daily lives, progressw will be quite slow.

- The most important factor for improving quickly is a clear understanding of each Stage: recognize the mental faculties you need to cultivate, adn the methods to overcome specific obstacles.

- The untrained mind produces distractions that lead to forgetting that results in mind-wandering.

- All we are doing in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention. Intentions lead to mental actions, and repeated mental actions become mental habits.
