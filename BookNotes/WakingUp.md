# Waking Up (Sam Harris)

- Awesome ! Changed my life.

- Our minds are all we have, they are the only things we will ever have and they are all we can give others.

- Each of us is looking for a path back to the presence: we are trying to find reasons to be satisfied NOW.

- How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experince an the quality of our lives.

- There is more to understaning the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit.

- Some well-established truths about the human mind:
  - our conventional sense of self is an illusion
  - positive illusions (compassions and patience) are teachable skills
  - the way we think directly influences our experinces of the world

- The sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes looking out at the world can be altered or entirely extinguished.

- Ceaseless change is an unreliable basis for lasting fulfillment.

- There is an alternative to being continuously spellbound by the conversation we are having with ourselves; There is an alternative to simply identifying with the next thought that pops into consciousness. And glimpsing this alternative dispels the conventional illusion of the self.

- Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow ones own advice.

- Cognition and emotion are not separate. The way we think about experince can completely determine how we feel about it. (see: lifting weights)

- It is possible to be at ease in the world for no reason, if only for a few moments at a time, such ease is synonymous with transcending the apparent boundries of the self.

- Unlike Buddhism, as manuals for contemplative understanding, the Bible and Koran are worse than useless.

- The purpose of the book is to encourge your to investigate certain contemplative  insights for yourself, without accepting the metaphysical ideas that they inspired in ignorant and isolated peoples of the past.

- It is always now. To realize this is liberating, there is nothing more important to understand if you want to be happy in the world.
  - We spend most of our lives forgetting this truth -- overlooking it, fleeing it, repudiating it. And the horror is that we suceed. We manage to avoid being happy while struggling to become happy.

- there is nothing passive about mindfulness. Being mindful is not a matter of thinking more clearly about experince; it is the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves.

- The problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without knowing that we are thinking.

- Mindfulness meditation is easy to describe, but hard to do. Practice is the only thing that will lead to success. Happly, the benefits of training arrive long before mastery.

- The goal is to come out of the discursive thinking and to stop reflexively grasping at the pleasant and recoiling from the unpleasant.

- Conventional sources of happiness are unreliable, being dependent upon changing conditions.

- According to Buddhist teachings, humans have a distorted view of reality that leads them to suffer unnecessarily. We grasp at transitory pleasures. We brood about the past and worry about the future. We continually try to prop up and defend the ego that doesnt exist.  By seenig things as they, are we cease to suffer in the usual ways and our minds can open to states of well-being that qare intrinsic to the nature of consciousness.

- Investigating the nature of consciousness itself and transforming its contents through deliberate training is the basis of spiritual life.

- As a matter of experince you are not a body of atoms, molecules and cells; you are consciousness and its ever-chaning contents.

- Consciousness is the one thing in this universe that cannot be an illusion.

- Only consciousness can know itself, directly throught first person experience. Rigorous introspection -- spirituality in the widest sence of the term -- is an indispensible part of understaning they nature of the mind.

- Whatever the final lesson of the split brain will be, it thoroughly violates our commonsense intuitions about the nature of our subjectivity.

- The conventional sense of self is an illusion; spirituality largely consists in realizing this, moment to moment.

- An empirical claim: look closely enought at your own mind in the present moment, and you will discover that the self is an illusion.

- We must build our own telescopes to judge the empirical claims of contemplatives

- Taking oneself to be the thinker of ones thoughts -- that is not recognizing the present thought to be a transitory appearance in consciousness --  is a delusion that produces nearly every species of human conflict and unhappiness.

- It is not enough to know, in the abstract, that thoughts continually arise or that one is thinking at this moment, for such knowledge is itself mediated by thoughts that are arising unrecognized. It is th e arising of these thoughts that produces the feeling of "I".  One must pay attentino closely to glimpse what consciousness is like between thoughts -- Consciousness doed not feel like a self.

- As a matter of neurology, the sense of having a perrsistent and unified self must be an illusion, because it is built upon processes that are transitory and multifarious. 

- A human mind is a wandering mind and a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.
