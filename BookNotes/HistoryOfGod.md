# History of God (Karen Armstrong)

- Very good in places. Somewhat repetitive.  I learned a lot.

- The concept of a personal God who behaves like a larger version of ourselves was suited to mankind at a certain stage but no longer works for an increasing number of people.
  Understanding the ever-changing ideas of God in the past and their relevance and usefulness in their time is a way to begin the search for a new concept for the 21C.

- Human beings are spiritual animals. Men and women starte to worship gods as soon as they became recogniziale human: they created religions at the same time as they created works of art.
  Like any other human activity, religion can be abused, but it seems to be something we've always done.
  our current secularism is an entirely new experiment, unpresidented in human history. We have yet to see how it will work.

- This book will not be a history of the ineffable reality of God itself, which is beyond time and change, but a history of the way men and women have prerceived him from Abraham to the present day.

- When once conception of God has ceased to have meaning or relevance, it has been quietly discarded and replaced by a new theology.
  A fundamentalist would deny this, since fundamentalism is antihistorical: it believes that Abraham, Moses and the later prophets all experienced their God in exactly the same way as people to today.
  Yet if we look at our three religions, it becomes clear that there is no objective view of "God": each generation has to create the image of God that works for it.

- Atheism has often been a transitional state: Jews, Christians, and Muslims were all called "atheists" by their pagan contemporaries because they had adopted a revolutionary notion of divinity and transcendence.

- Depspite its otherworldliness, religion is highly pragmatic. It is far more important for a particular idea of God to work than for it to be logically or scientifically sound.

- Buddists would deny that their visions and insights are derived from a supernatural source: they see them as natural to humanity.

- This will not be a history in the usual sense, since the idea of God has not evolved from one point and progressed in a linear fashion to a final conception.

- Because this is such a big subject, I have deliberately confined myself to the One God workshipped by Jews, Christians, and Muslims.
  Pagan, Hindu and Buddhist conceptions of ultimate reality are often considered to make a monotheistic point clearer.
  It seems that the idea of God is remarkably close to ideas in religions that developed quite independently.
  The history of the idea of God must tell us something important about the human mind and the nature of our aspiration.
  Despite the secular tenor of much of Western society, the idea of God still affects the lives of millions of people.

- Theology often comes accross as dull and abstract, but the history of God has been passionate and intense.
