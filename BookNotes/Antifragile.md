# Antifragile (Nassim Taleb)

- Wind extinguishes a candle and engerized fire. You want to be the fire and wish for wind.

- We are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. Id rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile.

- It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.
   Test for (anti)fragility: does it have more upside than downside from random events?

- We have been fragilizing almost everything: the economy, our health, politics, education... by suppressing randomness and volatility.
   Tragedy of modernity: those trying to help are often hurting us the most.

- In the past people of rank or status where the only ones who took risks: Heros.
  Today we are witnessing the rise of a new class of inverse heros, with too much power and no real downside and/or accountability.
  At no point in history ahve so many non-risk takers exerted so much control.

- Most of history comes from Black swans events.

- Less is more and is usually more effective.

- Time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder.

- If you see a fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.
  (Being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant to the nice.)
  
- The richer we become, the harder it is for us to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.

- If you need something done urgently give it to the busiest person in the office.

- Risk management professionals use the works-case scenario of the past to estimate future risks.
  However, this work-case event, when it happened exceeded the worst case at the time.

- Arguement against government indebtedness: When you dont have debt you dont care about your reputation in econmic circles.
  It is only when you dont care about your reputation that you have a good one. People lend the most to the people who need it the least.

- You may never know what type of person someone is unless they are given oppurtunities to violate moral or ethical codes.

- Someone who has made plenty of errors though never the same error more than once -- is more reliable than someone who has never made any.

- The avoidance of small mistakes makes the large one more severe.

- Government is needed most to enforce contracts.

- Some people have fallen for the naive belief that the world is getting safer: it is exactly like saying that nuclear bombs are safer b/c they explode less often.

- iatrogenics are harmful unintended side effects

- Iatrogenics is, should be, an important part of political science, economics, urban planning, education ...
   Iatrogenics of newspapers: They need to fill their pages everyday with a set of news items.
   Newpapers should be of two-line length on some days, and two hundred pages on other.

- Those who do too much somewhere do too little elsewhere. Those who tend to overedit also tend to miss the real typos.

- Hard to find heroes who became heros for nonaction.

- Procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility.
    Taleb uses procrastination as a messeage from his inner self to figure out what is worth writting about:
    	  "I write only if I feel like it and only on a subject I feel like writting about -- and the reader is no fool"


- Buffet: Invest in businesses that are "so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will.

- Wisdom in decision making is vastly more important than knowledge. #BeTheGood

- Invest in good actions. Things can be taken away from us -- not good deeds and acts of virtue.

- Upside in good deads: All good deads are expenditure; if any one returns it, that is a clear GAIN; if he does not return it, it is not lost, you gave for the sake of giving.

- The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans adn letting natural antifragility work by itself.

- Antifragility: agressiveness plus paranoia : clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black swans, take care of itself.

- An option is what makes you antifragile and allows you to benefit from the positive side of uncertianty, without a corresponding harm from the negaive side.

- Nature is all about the exploitation of optionality; it illistrates how optionalaity is a substitute for intelligence.
