# Antifragile (Nassim Taleb)

- Wind extinguishes a candle and engerized fire. You want to be the fire and wish for wind.

- We are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. Id rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile.

- It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.
   Test for (anti)fragility: does it have more upside than downside from random events?

- We have been fragilizing almost everything: the economy, our health, politics, education... by suppressing randomness and volatility.
   Tragedy of modernity: those trying to help are often hurting us the most.

- In the past people of rank or status where the only ones who took risks: Heros.
  Today we are witnessing the rise of a new class of inverse heros, with too much power and no real downside and/or accountability.
  At no point in history ahve so many non-risk takers exerted so much control.

- Most of history comes from Black swans events.

- Less is more and is usually more effective.

- Time is functionally similar to volatility: the more time, the more events, the more disorder.

- If you see a fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.
  (Being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant to the nice.)
  
- The richer we become, the harder it is for us to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.

- If you need something done urgently give it to the busiest person in the office.

- Risk management professionals use the works-case scenario of the past to estimate future risks.
  However, this work-case event, when it happened exceeded the worst case at the time.

- Arguement against government indebtedness: When you dont have debt you dont care about your reputation in econmic circles.
  It is only when you dont care about your reputation that you have a good one. People lend the most to the people who need it the least.

- You may never know what type of person someone is unless they are given oppurtunities to violate moral or ethical codes.

- Someone who has made plenty of errors though never the same error more than once -- is more reliable than someone who has never made any.

- The avoidance of small mistakes makes the large one more severe.

- Government is needed most to enforce contracts.

- Some people have fallen for the naive belief that the world is getting safer: it is exactly like saying that nuclear bombs are safer b/c they explode less often.
