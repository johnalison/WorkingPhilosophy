# Introductory Nuclear Physics (Kenneth Krane)

- Very solid. Learned a lot

- No other field of science comes readily to mind in which theory encompasses so broad a spectrum, from the most microscopic to the cosmic, nor is there another field in which direct applications of basic research contain the potential for the ultimate limits of good and evil.

- Nuclear physics lacks a coherent theoretical formulation that would permit us to analyze and interpret all phenomena in a fundamental way; atomic physics has such a formulation in quantum electrodynamics, which permits calculations of some observable quantities to more than six significant figures.
  As a result, we must discuss nuclear physics in a phenomenological way, using a different formulation to describe each different type of phenomenon, such as a decay, /3 decay, direct reactions, or fission.
  In place of a single unifying theory there are islands of coherent knowledge in a sea of seemingly uncorrelated observations.

- nuclear sizes are of order 1-10 fm

- Nuclear Kinetic energies in the nucleas are of order 10 MeV which is small compared to their rest energies, so we can use nonrelativistic QM.

- The list of instructions needed to build an exact replica of a French colonial house or a ’57 Chevy is relatively short; the list of instructions necessary to characterize all of the mutual interactions of the 50 nucleons in a medium weight nucleus could contain as many as 50! or about terms!

- To a considerable extent, we can describe a nucleus by a relatively small number of parameters: electric charge, radius, mass, binding energy, angular momentum, parity, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments, and energies of excited states.
  These are the static properties of nuclei that we consider in this chapter.
  In later chapters we discuss the dynamic properties of nuclei, including decay and reaction probabilities.
  To understand these static and dynamic properties in terms of the interaction between individual nucleons is the formidable challenge that confronts the nuclear physicist.

- One remarkable conclusion is obvious- the central nuclear charge density is nearly the same for all nuclei.

  Thus the number of nucleons per unit volume is roughly constant:

- The nuclear skin thickness is ~ fm (~2fm)

- In a heavy nucleus like Pb, the muonic 1s orbit has its mean radius inside the nuclear radius R; the effect of the nuclear size is a factor of 2 in the transition energies, a considerable improvement over the factor of le-4 o 1e-6 to in electronic transitions.

- Even though these measurements of the nuclear charge radius use very different techniques, they all give essentially the same results: the nuclear radius varies with mass number as R_o A^(1/3), with R_o , = 1.2 - 1.25 fm.

- the charge and matter radii of nuclei are nearly equal, to within about 0.1fm

- The measurement of nuclear masses occupies an extremely important place in the development of nuclear physics.

- The nuclear reaction method allows us to determine the masses of unstable nuclides whose masses cannot be measured directly.

-  Electronic binding energies are of order 10-100 keV in heavy atoms, while atomic mass energies are of order A x 1000 MeV; thus to a precision of about 1 part in l o 6 we can neglect them

- The average binding energy of most nuclei is, to within 10%, about 8 MeV per nucleon.
  Second, we note that the curve reaches a peak near A = 60, where the nuclei are most tightly bound.
  This suggests we can “gain” (that is, release) energy in two ways-below A = 60, by assembling lighter nuclei into heavier nuclei, or above A = 60, by breaking heavier nuclei into lighter nuclei.

  The most obvious term to include in estimating B/A (binding energy per nucleon) is the constant term, since to lowest order B ~ A.
  The contribution to the binding energy from this “ volume” term is thus B = a_v A where a_v, is a constant to be determined, which should be of order 8 MeV. 
  This linear dependence of the binding energy per nucleon is in fact somewhat surprising, and gives us our first insight into the properties of the nuclear force.
  If every nucleon attracted all of the others, then the binding energy would be proportional to A ( A - l),or roughly to A2.
  Since B varies linearly with A , this suggests that each nucleon attracts only its closest neighbors, and not all of the other nucleons.

- For even A, the pairing term gives two parabolas, displaced by 2 delta.
 This permits two unusual effects, not seen in odd-A decays:
      (1) some odd-2, odd-N nuclei can decay in either direction, converting a neutron to a proton or a proton to a neutron;
      (2) certain double beta decays can become energetically possible, in which the decay may change 2 protons to 2 neutrons.
