# Something Deeply Hidden (Sean Carroll)

- Great! Pushed me over the edge on many worlds, now firm believer! Sean Carroll one of my favorite authors!

- Physicists havent been honest with themselves about what QM says. We use QM, but honest physicists admit that we dont truly understand QM.

- When we teach QM to students they are taught a list of rules. Many of the familiar type (eg: how the system evolves smoothly in time).
  But then there are a bunch of extra rules that have no analogue in any other theory of physics.
  These extra rules tell us what happens when we observe the system; and the behaviour is completely different from how the system behaves when we are not observing it.
  What in the world is going on here?

- Two options: One is that the story we've been telling our students is woefully incomplete and for QM to qualify as a sensible theory we need to define (and understand) what a "measurement" of "observation" is and why it seems so different from what the system does otherwise. The other option is that QM represents a violent break from the way we have always thought about physics before, where the world does not exist independently of how we percieve it. Either way this should be discussed in the QM textbooks; its not!

- QM is unique among physical theories in drawing an apparent distinction between what we see and what really is.

- The quest to make sense of QM is not consisdered high-status specialty within modern physics.

- This book has three main messages:
  1) QM should be understandable and achieving this understanding should be a high-priority goil of modern science.
  2) We have made real progress toward this understanding.
  3) All this matters. 

- Many worlds is the purest way of making sense of QM - its where we end up if we just follow the path of least resistance in taking QM seriously.
  Multiple worlds are predictions of teh formalism that is already in place, not something added in by hand.
