# Something Deeply Hidden (Sean Carroll)

- Great! Pushed me over the edge on many worlds, now firm believer! Sean Carroll one of my favorite authors!

- High-level statement of why QM is different:
  - The QM world (unlike classical mechanics) is not perfectly transparent. What we see when we look at the world is fundamentally different from what actually is.
  - Gives probabilities, not certainties. Bells theorm implies these are not the probabilities we are familiar with (lack of full knowledge of system: eg in stat mech)

- Physicists havent been honest with themselves about what QM says. We use QM, but honest physicists admit that we dont truly understand QM.

- When we teach QM to students they are taught a list of rules. Many of the familiar type (eg: how the system evolves smoothly in time).
  But then there are a bunch of extra rules that have no analogue in any other theory of physics.
  These extra rules tell us what happens when we observe the system; and the behaviour is completely different from how the system behaves when we are not observing it.
  What in the world is going on here?

- Two options: One is that the story we've been telling our students is woefully incomplete and for QM to qualify as a sensible theory we need to define (and understand) what a "measurement" of "observation" is and why it seems so different from what the system does otherwise. The other option is that QM represents a violent break from the way we have always thought about physics before, where the world does not exist independently of how we percieve it. Either way this should be discussed in the QM textbooks; its not!

- QM is unique among physical theories in drawing an apparent distinction between what we see and what really is.

- The quest to make sense of QM is not consisdered high-status specialty within modern physics.

- This book has three main messages:
  1) QM should be understandable and achieving this understanding should be a high-priority goil of modern science.
  2) We have made real progress toward this understanding.
  3) All this matters. 

- Many worlds is the purest way of making sense of QM - its where we end up if we just follow the path of least resistance in taking QM seriously.
  Multiple worlds are predictions of teh formalism that is already in place, not something added in by hand.

- One of the themes of this book is that QM doesnt deserve the connotation of spookiness. But if there is something difficult or puzzling about a theory, the scientific response shoudl be to solve the puzzle, not pretend it isnt there. There is every reason to thinkg we can do that for QM just like all the other theories.

- Measurement problem: What exactly a measurement is, happens when we measure something, and what it tells us about the system being measured.
  There is no consensus within physics or philososphy about how to solve this problem.
  
- Classical mechanics is perfectly transparent; no need to talk about "interpretations of CM". We can precisely measure everything there is to know about a classical system without altering it in any way.
  Clear connection between what we see and what the theory describes. 

- QM is not perfectly transparent. What we see when we look at the world is fundamentally different from what actually is.

- In contrast to classical physics, the rules of textbook QM come in two parts: 1st part exactly parallels that we are used to in classical physics. "Diff-eq of rate of change of state."
  2nd part is describes what happens when we make a measurement.

- QM provides us probabilities rather than certianties. This may be annoying, but we can live with it. What should bug us is our lack of understanding of what is actually happening.

- QM in the form in which it is currently presented in physics textbooks, represents an oracle, not a true understanding.

- Originally thought the probablilites in QM were like those in statistically physics, representing our lack of knowledge of the true system. Bells theorem implies that this cannot be without non-local variables.

- Minimalist approach to QM:
  - Take the wave function seriously as a direct representation of reality. 
    (Notes: - Anything else would posit additional structure over and above the wavefunction.
    	    - This is a dramatic step! Wavefunctions are not what we observe when we look at the world! We see measurement outcomes not wavefunctions.)
  - Assume that the wave function always evolves smoothly according to the schrodinger eq.

  Summary: There is a wave function and it always evolves according to a determistic rule. That is all there is to say!
  
- Immediate problem: It sure seems like the wave function collapses when we do a meaurement. There is a good reason why the pioneers of QM invented the idea of wave function collapse: thats what they appear to do. Turn the question around: Rather than starting with what we see and trying to invenst a theory to explain it, start with minimalist QM (wave functions evolving only smoothly) and ask waht people in a world described by this theory would actually experience.

- "There is no such thing as the position of the electron" There is only the electrons wave function. This is QM implying a profound differnece between what we can observe and what there really is.
  Our observations arent revealing preexisting facts of which we were previously ignorant; at best, they reveal a tiny slice of a much bigger, fundamentally elusive reality.

- In minimalist QM there is nothing zipping around: there is ony the quantum state. Atoms arent mostly empty space; they are described by wave functions that stretch throughout then extent of the atom.
  Quantum reality is a wave function; classical positions and velocities are merely what we are able to observe when we probe that wave function.

- The minimalist QM attitude is that we shouldnt treat the measurement process as anything mystical or even in need of its own set of rules; the detector and electron simply interact with each other according to the laws of physics.

- If that where the whole story minimalist QM would be an untenable mess. Electrons in superpositions, detectors in superpositions, nothing much resembling the robust approximately classical world of our experience.  However the cloud of probability vanishes into nothingness for most possible combinations of electron location and detector image. Rather than the electorn and detector doing thier own thing, there is a connection between the systems.  You never feel like you have evolved into a superposition of different possible measurement outcomes; you simply think you have seen some specific outcome, which can be predicted with a definite probability. (This is why all the extra measurement rules where added to textbook QM)

- Constructing a scientific theory is not simply a matter of writting down some equations, we also need to indicate how those equations map onto the world. The right way to describe things after the measurement is not as one person with multiple ideas about where the electron was seen, but as multiple worlds, each of which contains a single person with a very definite idea about where the electron was seen.

- The price we pay for the vastly increased elegance of theoritcal formalism is that the theory describes many copies of what we think of as "the universe" each slightly different, but each truly real in some sense. Whether the benefit is worth the cost is an issue about which people disagree (it is).

- Note: In stumbling on the Many-worlds formalism, at not point did we take ordinary QM and tack on a bunch of worlds. All we did was point out that the potential of superstitions is naturally actualized in the cource of ordinary quantum evolution. Once you admit that an electron can be in a superpostion of different locations, ot follows that a person can be in a superposition of having seen the electron in different locations, and indeed that reality as a whole can be in a superposition, it becomes natural to treat every term in that superposition as a separate "world". We didnt add anything to QM, we just faced up to the what was there all along.

- The minimalist apporach is the "courageous" formulation of QM. It embodies the pholosophy that we should take seriously the simplest version of underlying reality that accounts for what we see, even if that reality differs wildly from our everyday experience. Do we have the courage to accept it?

- Every version of QM features two things:
  1) a wave function
  2) the Schrodinger equation

  The entierity of the minimalist (Everett) formalism is the insistence that there is nothing else.
