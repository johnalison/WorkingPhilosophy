- To convert temperature from one scale to another you need only remember that the F degree is 100/180 C = 5/9 C and that 0C is the same as 32F.

- Granite has grains of three diffeent substances: quartz mica and feldspar.

- Rocks are minerals (any chemical element, compound or other homogeneous meterial)

- Cast iron: is a mixture of iron and graphite (a form of carbon)
