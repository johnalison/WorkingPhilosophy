# General Chemistry (Linus Pauling)

- Good in places, dry in others. Good on details, lacks big picture. Bailed halfway. (p450)

- Its hard to draw a line between chemistry and other sciences.

- The metric system was developed during the French revolution.

- 1 ml = 1cm^3 or 1L = 10^-3 m^3

- The thermochemical calorie, ~ 3 J (4.184J) is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 g of water by 1C.

- To convert temperature from one scale to another you need only remember that the F degree is 100/180 C = 5/9 C and that 0C is the same as 32F.

- Granite has grains of three diffeent substances: quartz mica and feldspar.

- Rocks are minerals (any chemical element, compound or other homogeneous meterial)

- Cast iron: is a mixture of iron and graphite (a form of carbon)

- Ductility is the ease at which a substance can be drawn into a wire.

- Iron readily combines with oxygen in moist air to form iron rust. whereas an alloy of iron with chromium and nickel (stainless steel) is found to resist rusting.

-  Most bond lengths in molecults lie between 1 and 4 Angstroms (1A = 1e-10 m)

- Equilibrium is not a situation where nothing is happening, but rather a situation in which opposing reactions are taking place at the same rate so there is no overall change.

- Sublimation is the direct transition from solid (crystal) to gas or vice-versa.

- ONe atmosphere is ~100 kN m^-2.

- The g-factor of a proton (5.5855) is a suprising value and is evidence that the proton has complex structure and is not a simple partilce.

- Cation is attacted to the cathode (the negatively charged terminal); anion, which is a negatively charged atom or molecule is attracted to the anode (the positive terminal).

- Avogradros number is defined as the number of C-12 atoms in 12g of carbon 12.  6e23.

- Elements in the same group are called congeners
