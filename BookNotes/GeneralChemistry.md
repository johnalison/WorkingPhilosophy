# General Chemistry (Linus Pauling)

- Good in places, dry in others. Good on details, lacks big picture. Bailed halfway. (p450)

- Its hard to draw a line between chemistry and other sciences.

- The metric system was developed during the French revolution.

- 1 ml = 1cm^3 or 1L = 10^-3 m^3

- The thermochemical calorie, ~ 3 J (4.184J) is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 g of water by 1C.

- To convert temperature from one scale to another you need only remember that the F degree is 100/180 C = 5/9 C and that 0C is the same as 32F.

- Granite has grains of three diffeent substances: quartz mica and feldspar.

- Rocks are minerals (any chemical element, compound or other homogeneous meterial)

- Cast iron: is a mixture of iron and graphite (a form of carbon)

- Ductility is the ease at which a substance can be drawn into a wire.

- Iron readily combines with oxygen in moist air to form iron rust. whereas an alloy of iron with chromium and nickel (stainless steel) is found to resist rusting.

-  Most bond lengths in molecults lie between 1 and 4 Angstroms (1A = 1e-10 m)

- Equilibrium is not a situation where nothing is happening, but rather a situation in which opposing reactions are taking place at the same rate so there is no overall change.

- Sublimation is the direct transition from solid (crystal) to gas or vice-versa.

- ONe atmosphere is ~100 kN m^-2.

- The g-factor of a proton (5.5855) is a suprising value and is evidence that the proton has complex structure and is not a simple partilce.

- Cation is attacted to the cathode (the negatively charged terminal); anion, which is a negatively charged atom or molecule is attracted to the anode (the positive terminal).

- Avogradros number is defined as the number of C-12 atoms in 12g of carbon 12.  6e23.

- Elements in the same group are called congeners

- A triple bond in the N_2 molecule is extremely strong, making N_2 very stable.

- The power of attraction for the electrons in a covalent bond is called the electronegatively of the element.

- Fluorine is by far the most electronegative element, with oxygen in 2nd place, nitrogen and chlorine in 3rd.

- Hydrogen is found in most of the substances that constitute living matter, and in many inorganic substances. There are more compounds of hydrogen known that of any other element, carbon being a close second.

- The crystal of graphite can be described as built of giant flat molecules, loosely held together in a pile.

- Elementary Nitrogen occurs in nature in the atmosphere, where it makes up 80% by volume. It is a colorless, ordorless, tasteless gas of N_2 molecules.

- Oxygen is the most abundant element in the earths mantle. 90% of water 20% of air and nearly 50% of the common minerals (silicates)

- Flourine is the most reactive of all elements. Substances such as wood and rubber bursst into flames when help is a stream of fluorine.

- The hydrocarbons are compounds of hydrogen and carbon alone.
   Methane CH4 is an example. Natural gas is usually about 85% methane.
   Gasoline is a mixture of C_7 H_16 and C_9 H_20
   Kerosene a mixture of C_10 H_22 and C_16 H_34
   Lubricating oils "Vaseline" and solid paraffin are mixtures of still larger molecules

- lime is calcium oxide (CaO)

- Benzene rings of 6 carbon atomas are often shown simply as a hexagon. Organic chemists also drop the attached hydrogen atoms.

- Benzene and its derivatives are extremely important substances. They are used in the manufacture of drugs, explosives (TNT) and many other substances.  

- Basic (that is, it can add protons)

- An alcohol is obtained from a hydrocarbon by replacing one hydrogen atom by a hydroxyl group (-OH). Eg: methane CH4 gives methyl alcohol CH3-OH (causes blindness), and ethane C2H6 gives ethyl alchohol C2H5-OH (which is the active ingredite in alcoholic beverages.

- Nearly half of all the interesting inorganic compounds involve nonmetallic elements bonded to oxygen atoms.

- Carbon monoxide is poisonous because of its ability to combine with the hemoglobin on the bood in the same way that oxygen does.

- Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide.

- Free radica is an atom or group of atoms with one or more unshared electrons which can enter into chemical-bond formation.

- Combustion is the process of combining with oxygen.

- Gases differ remarkably from liquids and solids in that the volume of a sample of gas depends in a striking way on the temperature of the gas and the applied pressure.

- Maxwell showed that according to the kinetic theory the viscosity of a gas should be independent of pressure and should increase with increasing temperature, rather than decrease.
  These suprising preperties were verified by experiment, and the kinetic theory of gases was accepted long before a direct experimental determination of teh velocity distribution function could be carried out.

- 1 cal = 4.1840 J
        ~ 3 J

- The heat capacity of water is unusally large.

- The principle commerical method of production of ammonia is the Haber process, rthe direct combination of nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressure (several hundred atmospheres) in the presence of a catalyst.

- Waters physical properties are strikingly different from those of other substances, in wasy that determine the nature of the physical and biological world.
 
- Ordinary water is impure: it usually contains dissolved salts and disolved gases.  The impurity that is hardest to keep out of the water is carbon dioxide, which disolves readily from the air.

- Hard water is water containing cations of calcium, magnesium, and iron.

- Water has a very large dielectric constant.

- The unusual properites of water mentioned above are due to the power of its molecules to attract one another especially strongly. This power is associated with a the Hydrogen bond.
  Only the most electronegative atoms - fluorine, oxygen, nitrogen - form these bonds. Wanter is especially suitible to form hydrogen bonds because each molecule as two attached hydrogen atoms and two unshared electron pairs, and so can form four hydrogen bonds. The tetrahedral arrangement of the electron pairs causes these four bonds to extend in the four tetrahedral directions of space, and leads to the characteristic crystal structure of ice. It is a very open structure; each molecule is surrounded by only four immediate neighbors. This gives ice an abnormally low density. When ice melts, this structure is partially destroyed, adn the molecules are packed more clsely togeter, causing water to have a higher density than ice.

- One of the most striking properities of water its ability to dissolve many substances, forming aqueous solutions. Solutions are very important kinds of matter. The ocean is an aqueous solution that contains thousands of components. It was in this solution that the first living organisms developed, and from it that they obtained the ions and molecules neede for their growth and life. With time, organisms were evolved that could leave this aqueous environment, and move out onto the land and into the air. They achieved this abiliity by carrying the aqueous solutions with them, as tissue fluid, blood plasma, and cellular fluids containing the necessary supply of ions and molecules.

- Air is a gaseous solution of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor and the nobel gases.
