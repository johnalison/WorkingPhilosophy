# Spacetime Physics (Taylor and Wheeler)

- Great book! Probably the best introduction to relativity Ive seen. 
  Close analogy between change of geometric coordinates.
  Primacy on the interval

- The invariance of the interval -- its independence from the choice of the refernece frame -- forces one to recognize that time cannot be seperated from space. Space and time are part of a single entitity: spacetime. The geometry of spacetime is truly four dimensional. "The direction of the time axis" depends on the state of motion of the observer, just as the direction of the y-axis depends on the angle of the observer.

- The principles of relativity are remarkably simple. (Much simpler than the axioms of Euclid or the principles of operating a car, yet both of these have been mastered.  Some of the greatest minds of the 20C struggled with teh concepts of relativity. Not because it was obscure, but because man finds it difficult to outgrow established ways.

- Principle of Relativity: All the laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame. Both the form of the laws and the numerical values of the physical constants that these laws contain is the same in every inertial reference framce.

- We could go about locating events in spacetime soley by measuring the intervals between one event and the next, without any regaurd for the "space" and "time" coordinates individually. However we have to start as physics did before 1905 without the benifit of any concept of interval. This concept will force itself upon us as distance does for surveyors.

- One meter of light is 3.3 nanoseconds or light goes ~0.3 m = 1ft in a nanosecond.

- Synching clocks with a refernce light flash.  Can also move around a portable clock (However as we will see, the moving clock runs at a different rate, so it wont even agree with the orginal when it is brought back to the start)

- The word observer is a shorthand way of speaking about the whole collection of recording clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.

- On deriving the interval: To say that dt^2 = dx^x has a standard value is to say that the altitude of this right triangle has a fixed magnitude no matter how fast the rocket is moving.
  The keystone was the principle of relativity. (no differnece in laws of physics between reference frames)
  Was put to use twice in different ways:
      -) Used to reason that distances at right angles to the directions of relative motion are equal in the two frames.
      -) To deduce that ther speed of light must be the same in the laborator and rocket frame.

- The discremancy between clocks is caused by the character of the spacetime geometry itself.

- Proper time is to a world line in Lorentz geometry what length is to a path in Euclidean geometry.
  If the path between to points is "curved" it will take a longer distance / interval.
  In Lorentz geometry a curved world line between two events is shorter than the direct world line.

- Obsevers in differenrt frams will all agree on the proper time along a given world line between two specified points.

- Spacetime is the arena in which stars, atoms and people live andmove and have their being. Space is different for different observers. Time is different for different observers. Spacetime is the same for everyone.

- There is a minus sign in the formula (for the interval) that no sleight of hand can conjure away. This minus sign marks the differences in character between space and time.

- Light Cones: interval is zero between two events that can be connected by a ray of light. The light cone is a uniuqe feature of Lorentz geometry: no Euclidean equivalent.
  Defines funamental boundries to the basic causal structure of the universe.
  Light cones have existance quite apart from any coordinates that may be used to describe them.
  The causal structure is this independent of (and thus preserved in) all reference frames.

- Coordinates provide a "covariant" description of the separation of events in spacetime. vs invariant of the interval.
  "Co" previx implies a "coordinated variation of the coordinates..

- Lorentz Transformations:
  - The coefficients in the transformation are independent of the event under consideration.
  - The consideration gaurentee a point at rest in the rocket frame moves with velocity beta in the lab frame.
  - They also gaurentee the invariance of the interval.

- The covariant transformaiton in Euclidean geometry is analogus to the coordinate transformation in Lorentz geometry of the real physical world.
  The inverse slope of the axis of one coordinate system relative to the other is analogous to teh velocity of one interial reference frame relative to another.

- The velocity parameter (like the relative slope between frame in the Euclidean analogy) is not the simplest way to describe the relation between coordinate frames.
  Angle is a better measure of rotation and velocity parameter eta is the most convenient measure of velocity
