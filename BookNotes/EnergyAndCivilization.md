# Energy and Civilization (Vaclav Smil)

- Learned a lot. Repetive and boring at times.

- Energy is the only universal currency: one of its many forms must be transformed to get anything done.

- From a fundamental biolphysical perspective, both prehistoric human evolution and the course of history can be seen as the quest for controlling greater stores and flows of more concentrated and more versatile forms of energy and converting them in more affordable ways into heat, light, and motion.

- Only a tiny part of the the incoming radiant energy, less than 0.05% is transformed into photosynthesis into stores of chemical energy.

- One C is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 cc of wanter by 1 C.
  Onc C is ~4 J.
  For most moderately active adulte need 2-2.7 Mcal or 8-11 MJ (10MJ could be supplied by eating 1 kg of whole wheat bread)
  Consuming 8 MJ of food a day corresponds to a power rate of 90W, light less than the the rating of a standard light bulb (100 W).
  A double toaster needs 1kW; small cars deliver 50kW; a large power plant produces electricity at 2 GW.

  Hard work will raise the daily energy need by ~30%. Book assumes 2MJ/day in approximate calculation of the daily expenditures in tradional farming and industrial work.

  Efficiency of steady aerobic performance is ~20% and this means that 20MJ/day of metabolic energy attributable to a physical task would produce 400kJ/day of useful work.

- The power densisty of sustainable annual tree growth in temperate climates is at best 2% of teh power density of energy consumption for traditional urban heating, cooking and manufacturing. This cities had to draw on nearby areas at least 30 times their size for fuel supply. This greatly restricted their growth even where other resources, eg: food and water, were adequate.

- A real understanding of history requires much more than reducing everything to numerical accounts in J and W and treating them as all emcompasing explanations.

- Humabn bipedalism and ability to sweat better than any other mammal made it possible to chase to exhaustion even the fastest herbivores.

- Only grains combine fairly high yeilds with high shares of easily digestible carbs and a moderate level of protiens
  Their moisture content when dried is low enough to allow long-term storage.
  Staple grains mature fast 100-150 days.


- Traditional agricultures could support population densities that were an order of magnitude larger than foraging societies.

- Productive limits on traditional agricultures were removed only by rising inputs of fossil fuels, an energy subsidy that reduced agricultural labor to only a small fraction of the total labor force and enabled the rise of modern high-energy urban societies.

- Without sickle and plow there would be no cathedrals or no European voyages of discovery.

- The shift from foraging to farming left a clear physical record in our bones. A decrease in bending strength of leg bones and the population shifted to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. This process was complete about 2e3 years ago, and there as been no further decline in bone strength since then.

- Plowing prepares the ground for seeding much more thoroughly than hoeing: it breaks up comacted soil, uproots weeds, and provides loosened, well-aerates ground in which seedlings can germinate and thrive.

- The water content of freshly harvested tubers is too high for long-term storage in absense of terperature and humidity controls.

- Dependence on cereal grains is a matter of clear energy advantages.
  In terms of total energy content, all cereals are remarkably similar.
  The buld of cereals food energy is in carbs. 

- Protiens have the same energy density as carbs, but their primary role in human nutrition is not as a source of energy but as a provider of 9 essential amino acids whole ingestion is essentioal to build and repair body tissues.

- The quest for high yields needed three essential advances:
  - replacement of human work by animal labor
  - irrigation and fertilization
  - growing a greater variety of crops.

- A horse's leg anatomy gives the animal a unique advantage by virtually eliminating the energy costs of standing.
  Can "lock" the limb without engaging muscles allowing the animals to rest even doze while standing.

  All other animals need 10% more energy when standing compared to lying down.

- The water demand of crops is commonly about 1e3 times then mass of harvested grain.

- Atmosphereic C02 and water supply carbon and hydrogen, the two elements forming the buld of plant tissues as new carbohydrates.
  But other elements are necessary for photosynthesis (marconutrients and microneutrients)
   Micro: many including: iron , copper, sulfur, silica and calcium
   Marco: only 3: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (N,P,K)
   Nitrogen is by far teh most important one: it is present it all enzymes and protiens and is the element to be most likely in short supply in cultivated soils
   Each kg of nitrogen will result in an additional production of about 10kg of grain

- The organic fertilizer with teh highest nitrogen content is guano, droppings of seabirds preserved in the dry climiate of islands along the Peruvian coast.

- By the time Egypt was supplying the Roman empire with surplus grain, the Chines (Han dynasty) had develop several tools and practices that Europe adopted only centuries or even millennium later.
  Iron moldbard plows, collar harness for horses, seed drills, and rotary winnowing fans.

- Although heavier than wooden plows, iron plows created much less friction and could be pulled by a single animal.

- No other dynastic period can compare with teh Han in terms of fundamental changes in farming.
  Irrigation was teh most important and lasting contribution.

- Mayan socient was developing gradually for a long time before the beginning of the Classic period (300 CE) Then, in one of teh most enigmatic turns in world history, the classical Mayan society disintegrated and its population declined from about 3e6 during the 8C to 1e5 by the time of the Spanish conquest.

- During the 1880s American coal consumption surpassed wood combustion.

- In 1910 Americas farm horse herd required almost 25% of teh country's cultivated land.

- All traditional peasants behaved as gamblers. They tried to stay on teh slim margins of food surplus too long, betting that weather would help to produce another fiar harvest next year.

- Animate labor and conversions of the kinetic energies of water and wind (by sails and mills) where the only prime movers in traditional societies before steam engines.

- Simple mechanical devices: Give were widely used in teh Old World:
   wheel and axle, lever, system of pulleys, wedge, endless screw

- The Americas has no native wheels

- Ten men working steadily would equal the power of one standard horse.

- Windmills, barbed wire and railroads where the iconic artifacts that helped open up the Great Plains

- Wood: Carbon accounts for 45% of the total mass. Oxygen: 40%
  Freshly cut hardwoods are typically 30% water. This woods burn inefficiently as a significant part of the heat goes into vaporizing released moisture.
  Charcoal (virtually pure carbon) contains only a trace of moisture, it was always preferred by those who could afford it.

- In Western Europe, the Roman achievements in road building where surpassed only during the 19C, in teh eastern regions on during the 20th.

- The steam engine had actually expanded the deployment of horses; most railway shipments had to be collected adn distributed by horsedrawn wagons. 
  Horse drawn city traffic was largely displaced by electric streetcars, cars and busses.
  
- The enourmous variety of building styles and ornaments can be reduced to only four fundamental structural members: walls, columns, beams adn arches.
  Only human labor, aided by a few simple tools, was able to creat them from teh three basic building materials of the preindustrial world: timer, stone and bricks.
