# Energy and Civilization (Vaclav Smil)

- Learned a lot. Repetive and boring at times.

- Energy is the only universal currency: one of its many forms must be transformed to get anything done.

- From a fundamental biolphysical perspective, both prehistoric human evolution and the course of history can be seen as the quest for controlling greater stores and flows of more concentrated and more versatile forms of energy and converting them in more affordable ways into heat, light, and motion.

- Only a tiny part of the the incoming radiant energy, less than 0.05% is transformed into photosynthesis into stores of chemical energy.

- One C is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 cc of wanter by 1 C.
  Onc C is ~4 J.
  For most moderately active adulte need 2-2.7 Mcal or 8-11 MJ (10MJ could be supplied by eating 1 kg of whole wheat bread)
  Consuming 8 MJ of food a day corresponds to a power rate of 90W, light less than the the rating of a standard light bulb (100 W).
  A double toaster needs 1kW; small cars deliver 50kW; a large power plant produces electricity at 2 GW.

  Hard work will raise the daily energy need by ~30%. Book assumes 2MJ/day in approximate calculation of the daily expenditures in tradional farming and industrial work.

  Efficiency of steady aerobic performance is ~20% and this means that 20MJ/day of metabolic energy attributable to a physical task would produce 400kJ/day of useful work.

- The power densisty of sustainable annual tree growth in temperate climates is at best 2% of teh power density of energy consumption for traditional urban heating, cooking and manufacturing. This cities had to draw on nearby areas at least 30 times their size for fuel supply. This greatly restricted their growth even where other resources, eg: food and water, were adequate.

- A real understanding of history requires much more than reducing everything to numerical accounts in J and W and treating them as all emcompasing explanations.
