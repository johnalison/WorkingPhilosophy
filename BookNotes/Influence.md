# Influence (Robert Caldini)
  - Very good. Reads well, learned a lot
  - Six basic tactics to get compliance. Each governed by fundamental psychological principle that directs human behavior:
    Consistency / Reciprocation / Social Proof / Authority / Liking / Scarcity
  - Well known principle of human behavior: when we ask someone to do us a favor will be more successful if we provide a reason.
  - As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow more intricate and variable we will have to depend increasingly on shortcuts to handle them all.
  - Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.
  - Odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future importance most of us know very little about our own automatic behavior patterns
  - Contrast Principle: If second item fairly different from 1st, we will tend to see it more differently than it actually is.
  - We are human b/c our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in a honored network of obligation
  - Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule => they made sure thier members are trined to comply and believe in it.
  - Desire to be and look consistent is a highly potent weopn of social influence often causing us to act in ways contray to our best interest.
  - Social Proof: thinking short cut, find out what others think is correct (Also vulnerable to attack)
  - When we are unsure of ourselves, when there is uncertianty, we are most likely to look and to accept the actions of others as correct.
  - Fake applause at opera: "Claque" / "Chef de claque"
  - How to defend against authority : "Is this authority truly an expert ? " / "How trustful can we expect the expert to be here?"
  - With all six of these principles we are usually and efficiently correct.
  - They fact that news conveying the fact that a product is going to be scarce is itself (the news) scarse makes it esp. persuasive.
  - Knowing these weapons of persuasion is often not enough. Knowing is a congnitive thing, cognitive proecesses are supress by our emotional reactions to the different weapons.
