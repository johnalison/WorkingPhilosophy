# Subtle is the Lord (Abe Pais)

- Great history.

- Einstein never stopped pondering the meaning of Quantum theory. He would always return to the QM and its interpertation.
  "I have thought 100 times as much about quantum problems as I have about general relativity theory"

- Lorentz was the one father figure in his life. He claimed that without Lorentz he would never have been able to discover special relativity.

- Special Relativity brought clarity to old physics (E&M, the ether) and created new physics E=mc^2

- Einsteins one revolutionary contribution to physics was his assumption that light, in its coupling to matter, is created and destroyed in descreter particles of energy.
  Never was a proposal for a new fundamental particle resisted more strongly than this one for the photon. No one resisted the photon longer than Bohr. All resistence came to an end when experiments on the scattering of light by electrons (the Compton effect) proved Einstein was right.  QM was born within a few months of settling the photon issue.

- Einstein never had a good word for QFT.

- In all the history of physics there has never been a period of transition as abrupt, unanticipated and over a wide front as the decade from 1895 to 1905.
  X-rays (1895), Zeeman effect (1896), radioactivity (1896), the electron (1897) the extension of IR spectroscopy into the 3mu to 60um region (critical for the study of blackbody radiation).
