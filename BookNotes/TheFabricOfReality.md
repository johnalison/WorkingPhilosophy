# The Fabric of Reality (David Deutsch)

- Another one of my favorite authors. Not as good as Beginning of Infinity, but very interesting.  Got a little wacky in places.

- Thanks to a succession of extraordinary discoveries, we posess some extreemly deep theories about the structure of reality.
  the book aims to develop a world view that takes these ideas seriously (for what they  actually say) and incorperate them into a comprehensive view of reality.
  Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make far more sense than common sense does.
  We must take them seriously as EXPLANATIONS of the world.
  We can reach the greatest understanding by taking them together.

- Seems odd that this view point should be in anyway controversial, yet in practice it is. Each of these theories, when taken seriously, have very counter-intuitive implications
  All sorts of attempts have been made to avoid these implications (eg; ad hoc modifications or interpretations of the theories, or arbitrarily narrowing the domain of applicability) or using them only as a tool for prediction not as an explanation. This book is an investigation of what reality would look like if they were true.

- Facts cannot be understood just by being summarized, the can be understood only by being explained. Fortunately our best theories embody deep explanations in addition to accurate predictions.
  Explanation is the entire content of a theory. the most valuale part of the theory is that it explains a reality that we cannot directly perceive. 

- Some philosophers -- and even some scientist -- disparage the role of explanation in science. However the overwhelming majority of theories are rejected b/c they are bad explanations not b/c they fail experimental tests. (eg: eating a kg of grass is a cure for the common cold)

- To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse the means with the ends. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.

- Explanation is a strange sort of food -- a larger portion is not nessecarily harder to swallow. It is hard to give a precise defintion for explanation or understanding. They are more about the "why" than the "what"; about how things really are rather than how they appear to be.

- At present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation -- or of wanting one in the first place -- other than a human mind.

- We understand the fabric of reality only by understanding theories that explain it.

- Our theories are increasing in both depth and breadth. Breadth makes them harder to understand, depth make them easier to understand. One thesis of this book is that (slowly but surely) depth is winning.

- Higher level subjects are studied beacuse under special circumstances the ridiculously complex behaviours of the vast number of particles involved resolves itself into a measure of simplicity and comprehensibility. This is called emergence: high-level simplicity emerges from low-level complexity.

- The structure of scientific explanation does not reflect the reductionist hierarchy. (B/c of emergence) There are explanations on every level of the hierarchy.
  If fact the very concept "high leve" vs "low level" are misnomers. The laws of biology are high-level emergent consequences of the laws of physics, but logically, some of the laws of physics are then "emergent" consequences of the laws of biology.

- What makes a theory more fundamental and less derivative is not closesness to the predicitive base of physics, but its closeness to our deepest explanatory theories.

  Our deepest theories are:
      - Quantum Theory
      - The Theory of Evolution
      - Epistemology
      - The Theory of Computation

  Deep and diverse connections have been discovered between the basic principles of these theories. It has become impossible to reach our best understanding of any one of them without also understanding the other three.  Taken together they form a coherent explanatory structure that is far reaching. Claim: Our scope of understanding begins to be fully universal. This "Theory of Everything" has a far wider scope than the "theory of everything" that elementary particle physicists are seeking. The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients such as space, time and subatomic particles, but also for example, life, thought, and computation.

- The basic experiments that demonstrate QM and the necessity of many worlds ae austere and they require neither specialized scientific instruments or any great knowledge of math or physics. The essentially involve nothing but casting shadows. The patters of light and shadow that an ordinary light can cast are very strange.
  Explaining them requires not just a new physical law, but a new level of description and explanation that goes beyond what was previously regaurded as being in the scope of science.

- Careful experiments show that light does not always travel in straight lines, sometimes it bends.

- How ductile is light ? How fine a thread can it be drawn into ? Gold can be drawn into threads one 10^-7 m thick.  It turns out that light is not as ductile as gold.

- The interfering entities behave exactly like photons ... except that they cannot be seen.  It appears that photons come it two sorts "tangible" and "shadow" photons. Tangible are the normal photons we can see. Shadow photons are invisible, detectable only indirectly through their interference effects on the tangible photons. What we infer is that each tangible photon has an accompanying retinue of shadow photons, and when a photon passes through one of the four slits, some of the shadow photons pass through the other three. Experiments imply thqat there must be at least a trillion (10^12) shadow photons for each tangible one. The only thing in the universe that shadow photons can be observed to affect is the tangible photons that it accompanies. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for the phenomenon of interference. Reality is a much bigger thing that it seems, most of it is invisible. We, with our instruments, can only observe the tip of the iceberg.


- Hence there is some sort of shadow barrier at the same location as the tangible barrier. It takes no great leap of imaginatino to conclude that the shadow barrier is made up of shadow atoms that we already know bust be present as counterparts of tangible atoms in the barrier.

- The behaviour of objects that we observe can be explained only if there are unobserved objects, with very specific properties, present. Single particle interference unequivocally rules out the possibility that the tangible universe around us is all that exists.

- This talk of tangible and shadow atoms and photons is only compelling to those who seek explanations. This worldview is much more integrated, and makes more sense in so many ways, than any previous worldview, and certainly mare than the cynical pragmatism which too often nowadays serves as a surrogate for a worldview among scientists.

- Our primary objective is to understand reality.

- "The possible" cannot interact with the real: non-existent entities cannot deflect real ones from thier paths.

- Every subatomic particle has conterparts in other universes and is interferred with only by those counterparts. It is not directly affected by any other particles in those universes. Therefore interference is observed only in special situations where the paths of a particle and its shadow counterparts separate and then reconverge (eg: when the photon and its shadow photon hit the same part on the screen). The detection of interference between any two universes requires an interaction to take place between ALL the particles whose positions and other attributes are not identical in the two universes.

- "Observation destroys interference" is very misleading in three ways
    -) it suggest some form of psychokinetic effect of the conscious "observer" on basic physical phenomena, though there is no such effect
    -) the interference is not "destroyed" it is just (much!) harder harder to observe b/c doing so requries controlling the precise behaviour of so many particles.
    -) it is not just "observation" but any effect of the photon on its surroundings that depends on which path the photon has taken that does this.

- We do not need deep theories to tell us that parallel universes exist -- single particle interference tells us that. It turns out the QM natually implies and refers to parallel universes (in the superposition of wave functions). IF our best theory of physics did not refer to parallel universes, it would merely mean that we needed a better theory, one that did, in order to explain what we see.

- The quantum theory of parallel universes is not the problem, it is the solution. It is not some troublesome, optional interpretation emerging from arcane theoretical considerations. It is the explanation -- the only one that is tenable -- of a remarkable and counter-intuitive reality.

- I may feel subjectively that I am distinguished among the copies as THE "tangible" one, beacuse I can directly percieve myself and not the others, but I must come to terms with the fact that all the others feel the same way about themselves.

- Sumamry: in interference experiments there can be places in a shadow-pattern that go dark when new openings are made in the barrier casting the shadow. This remains true when the experiment is performed on individual particles. A chain of reasoning based on this fact rules out the possibility that the universe we see around us constitutes the whole of reality. In fact the whole of physical reality, the multiverse, contains vast numbers of parallel universes.
