# The Fabric of Reality (David Deutsch)

- Another one of my favorite authors. Not as good as Beginning of Infinity, but very interesting.  Got a little wacky in places.

- Thanks to a succession of extraordinary discoveries, we posess some extreemly deep theories about the structure of reality.
  the book aims to develop a world view that takes these ideas seriously (for what they  actually say) and incorperate them into a comprehensive view of reality.
  Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make far more sense than common sense does.
  We must take them seriously as EXPLANATIONS of the world.
  We can reach the greatest understanding by taking them together.

- Seems odd that this view point should be in anyway controversial, yet in practice it is. Each of these theories, when taken seriously, have very counter-intuitive implications
  All sorts of attempts have been made to avoid these implications (eg; ad hoc modifications or interpretations of the theories, or arbitrarily narrowing the domain of applicability) or using them only as a tool for prediction not as an explanation. This book is an investigation of what reality would look like if they were true.

- Facts cannot be understood just by being summarized, the can be understood only by being explained. Fortunately our best theories embody deep explanations in addition to accurate predictions.
  Explanation is the entire content of a theory. the most valuale part of the theory is that it explains a reality that we cannot directly perceive. 

- Some philosophers -- and even some scientist -- disparage the role of explanation in science. However the overwhelming majority of theories are rejected b/c they are bad explanations not b/c they fail experimental tests. (eg: eating a kg of grass is a cure for the common cold)

- To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse the means with the ends. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.

- Explanation is a strange sort of food -- a larger portion is not nessecarily harder to swallow. It is hard to give a precise defintion for explanation or understanding. They are more about the "why" than the "what"; about how things really are rather than how they appear to be.

- At present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation -- or of wanting one in the first place -- other than a human mind.

- We understand the fabric of reality only by understanding theories that explain it.

- Our theories are increasing in both depth and breadth. Breadth makes them harder to understand, depth make them easier to understand. One thesis of this book is that (slowly but surely) depth is winning.

- Higher level subjects are studied beacuse under special circumstances the ridiculously complex behaviours of the vast number of particles involved resolves itself into a measure of simplicity and comprehensibility. This is called emergence: high-level simplicity emerges from low-level complexity.

- The structure of scientific explanation does not reflect the reductionist hierarchy. (B/c of emergence) There are explanations on every level of the hierarchy.
  If fact the very concept "high leve" vs "low level" are misnomers. The laws of biology are high-level emergent consequences of the laws of physics, but logically, some of the laws of physics are then "emergent" consequences of the laws of biology.

- What makes a theory more fundamental and less derivative is not closesness to the predicitive base of physics, but its closeness to our deepest explanatory theories.

  Our deepest theories are:
      - Quantum Theory
      - The Theory of Evolution
      - Epistemology
      - The Theory of Computation

  Deep and diverse connections have been discovered between the basic principles of these theories. It has become impossible to reach our best understanding of any one of them without also understanding the other three.  Taken together they form a coherent explanatory structure that is far reaching. Claim: Our scope of understanding begins to be fully universal. This "Theory of Everything" has a far wider scope than the "theory of everything" that elementary particle physicists are seeking. The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients such as space, time and subatomic particles, but also for example, life, thought, and computation.
