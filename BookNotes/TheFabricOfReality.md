# The Fabric of Reality (David Deutsch)

- Another one of my favorite authors. Not as good as Beginning of Infinity, but very interesting.  Got a little wacky in places.

- Thanks to a succession of extraordinary discoveries, we posess some extreemly deep theories about the structure of reality.
  the book aims to develop a world view that takes these ideas seriously (for what they  actually say) and incorperate them into a comprehensive view of reality.
  Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make far more sense than common sense does.
  We must take them seriously as EXPLANATIONS of the world.
  We can reach the greatest understanding by taking them together.

- Seems odd that this view point should be in anyway controversial, yet in practice it is. Each of these theories, when taken seriously, have very counter-intuitive implications
  All sorts of attempts have been made to avoid these implications (eg; ad hoc modifications or interpretations of the theories, or arbitrarily narrowing the domain of applicability) or using them only as a tool for prediction not as an explanation. This book is an investigation of what reality would look like if they were true.

- Facts cannot be understood just by being summarized, the can be understood only by being explained. Fortunately our best theories embody deep explanations in addition to accurate predictions.
  Explanation is the entire content of a theory. the most valuale part of the theory is that it explains a reality that we cannot directly perceive. 

- Some philosophers -- and even some scientist -- disparage the role of explanation in science. However the overwhelming majority of theories are rejected b/c they are bad explanations not b/c they fail experimental tests. (eg: eating a kg of grass is a cure for the common cold)

= To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse the means with the ends. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.
