# The Fabric of Reality (David Deutsch)

- Another one of my favorite authors. Not as good as Beginning of Infinity, but very interesting.  Got a little wacky in places.

- Thanks to a succession of extraordinary discoveries, we posess some extreemly deep theories about the structure of reality.
  the book aims to develop a world view that takes these ideas seriously (for what they  actually say) and incorperate them into a comprehensive view of reality.
  Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make far more sense than common sense does.
  We must take them seriously as EXPLANATIONS of the world.
  We can reach the greatest understanding by taking them together.

- Seems odd that this view point should be in anyway controversial, yet in practice it is. Each of these theories, when taken seriously, have very counter-intuitive implications
  All sorts of attempts have been made to avoid these implications (eg; ad hoc modifications or interpretations of the theories, or arbitrarily narrowing the domain of applicability) or using them only as a tool for prediction not as an explanation. This book is an investigation of what reality would look like if they were true.

- Facts cannot be understood just by being summarized, the can be understood only by being explained. Fortunately our best theories embody deep explanations in addition to accurate predictions.
  Explanation is the entire content of a theory. the most valuale part of the theory is that it explains a reality that we cannot directly perceive. 

- Some philosophers -- and even some scientist -- disparage the role of explanation in science. However the overwhelming majority of theories are rejected b/c they are bad explanations not b/c they fail experimental tests. (eg: eating a kg of grass is a cure for the common cold)

- To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse the means with the ends. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.

- Explanation is a strange sort of food -- a larger portion is not nessecarily harder to swallow. It is hard to give a precise defintion for explanation or understanding. They are more about the "why" than the "what"; about how things really are rather than how they appear to be.

- At present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation -- or of wanting one in the first place -- other than a human mind.

- We understand the fabric of reality only by understanding theories that explain it.

- Our theories are increasing in both depth and breadth. Breadth makes them harder to understand, depth make them easier to understand. One thesis of this book is that (slowly but surely) depth is winning.

- Higher level subjects are studied beacuse under special circumstances the ridiculously complex behaviours of the vast number of particles involved resolves itself into a measure of simplicity and comprehensibility. This is called emergence: high-level simplicity emerges from low-level complexity.

- The structure of scientific explanation does not reflect the reductionist hierarchy. (B/c of emergence) There are explanations on every level of the hierarchy.
  If fact the very concept "high leve" vs "low level" are misnomers. The laws of biology are high-level emergent consequences of the laws of physics, but logically, some of the laws of physics are then "emergent" consequences of the laws of biology.

- What makes a theory more fundamental and less derivative is not closesness to the predicitive base of physics, but its closeness to our deepest explanatory theories.

  Our deepest theories are:
      - Quantum Theory
      - The Theory of Evolution
      - Epistemology
      - The Theory of Computation

  Deep and diverse connections have been discovered between the basic principles of these theories. It has become impossible to reach our best understanding of any one of them without also understanding the other three.  Taken together they form a coherent explanatory structure that is far reaching. Claim: Our scope of understanding begins to be fully universal. This "Theory of Everything" has a far wider scope than the "theory of everything" that elementary particle physicists are seeking. The fabric of reality does not consist only of reductionist ingredients such as space, time and subatomic particles, but also for example, life, thought, and computation.

- The basic experiments that demonstrate QM and the necessity of many worlds ae austere and they require neither specialized scientific instruments or any great knowledge of math or physics. The essentially involve nothing but casting shadows. The patters of light and shadow that an ordinary light can cast are very strange.
  Explaining them requires not just a new physical law, but a new level of description and explanation that goes beyond what was previously regaurded as being in the scope of science.

- Careful experiments show that light does not always travel in straight lines, sometimes it bends.

- How ductile is light ? How fine a thread can it be drawn into ? Gold can be drawn into threads one 10^-7 m thick.  It turns out that light is not as ductile as gold.

- The interfering entities behave exactly like photons ... except that they cannot be seen.  It appears that photons come it two sorts "tangible" and "shadow" photons. Tangible are the normal photons we can see. Shadow photons are invisible, detectable only indirectly through their interference effects on the tangible photons. What we infer is that each tangible photon has an accompanying retinue of shadow photons, and when a photon passes through one of the four slits, some of the shadow photons pass through the other three. Experiments imply thqat there must be at least a trillion (10^12) shadow photons for each tangible one. The only thing in the universe that shadow photons can be observed to affect is the tangible photons that it accompanies. Shadow photons would go entirely unnoticed were it not for the phenomenon of interference. Reality is a much bigger thing that it seems, most of it is invisible. We, with our instruments, can only observe the tip of the iceberg.


- Hence there is some sort of shadow barrier at the same location as the tangible barrier. It takes no great leap of imaginatino to conclude that the shadow barrier is made up of shadow atoms that we already know bust be present as counterparts of tangible atoms in the barrier.

- The behaviour of objects that we observe can be explained only if there are unobserved objects, with very specific properties, present. Single particle interference unequivocally rules out the possibility that the tangible universe around us is all that exists.

- This talk of tangible and shadow atoms and photons is only compelling to those who seek explanations. This worldview is much more integrated, and makes more sense in so many ways, than any previous worldview, and certainly mare than the cynical pragmatism which too often nowadays serves as a surrogate for a worldview among scientists.

- Our primary objective is to understand reality.

- "The possible" cannot interact with the real: non-existent entities cannot deflect real ones from thier paths.

- Every subatomic particle has conterparts in other universes and is interferred with only by those counterparts. It is not directly affected by any other particles in those universes. Therefore interference is observed only in special situations where the paths of a particle and its shadow counterparts separate and then reconverge (eg: when the photon and its shadow photon hit the same part on the screen). The detection of interference between any two universes requires an interaction to take place between ALL the particles whose positions and other attributes are not identical in the two universes.

- "Observation destroys interference" is very misleading in three ways
    -) it suggest some form of psychokinetic effect of the conscious "observer" on basic physical phenomena, though there is no such effect
    -) the interference is not "destroyed" it is just (much!) harder harder to observe b/c doing so requries controlling the precise behaviour of so many particles.
    -) it is not just "observation" but any effect of the photon on its surroundings that depends on which path the photon has taken that does this.

- We do not need deep theories to tell us that parallel universes exist -- single particle interference tells us that. It turns out the QM natually implies and refers to parallel universes (in the superposition of wave functions). IF our best theory of physics did not refer to parallel universes, it would merely mean that we needed a better theory, one that did, in order to explain what we see.

- The quantum theory of parallel universes is not the problem, it is the solution. It is not some troublesome, optional interpretation emerging from arcane theoretical considerations. It is the explanation -- the only one that is tenable -- of a remarkable and counter-intuitive reality.

- I may feel subjectively that I am distinguished among the copies as THE "tangible" one, beacuse I can directly percieve myself and not the others, but I must come to terms with the fact that all the others feel the same way about themselves.

- Sumamry: in interference experiments there can be places in a shadow-pattern that go dark when new openings are made in the barrier casting the shadow. This remains true when the experiment is performed on individual particles. A chain of reasoning based on this fact rules out the possibility that the universe we see around us constitutes the whole of reality. In fact the whole of physical reality, the multiverse, contains vast numbers of parallel universes.

- Not clear which is stranger the behavious of the shadows itself, or the fact that contemplating them can force us to revise so radically our conception of the structure of reality.

- Observations of every smaller physical effects have been forcing ever greater changes in our world-view

- Solipsism (that only our mind exists) cannot be logically disproved. Since solipsism is an infinite number of related theories are logically consistent with perceiving any possible observational evidence, it follows that you can logically deduce nothing about realty from observational evidence alone.  If scientific reason does not amount to logical deduction from evidence what does it amount to?

 Theories that are more capable of giving more detailed explanation are automatically preferred.

- A problem (when the explanations of our best theories seem inadequate) is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.

- Popper's theory that knowledge can grow only through conjecture and refutation (or criticism) "Evolutionary epistemology" and is an important unifying insight.

- In science and biological evolution, evolutionary sucess depends on the creation and survival of objective knowledge, which in biology is called adaptation.

- There are a large class of theories related to solipsism, differing on where they draw the boundry demarkating the part of reality which is comprehensible and that to which science is inapplicable.

- Against Solipsism:  Joke/argument against solipsism: Professor who give a lecture in defence of solipsism. The students agree with every word of it. 'One so seldom has the oppurtunity to meet fellow solipsists'. What actually did the students agree with? If they adopt the professors opinion, they will not be solipsists, and if they become solipsists, they will have become convinced that the professor is mistaken. If we take solipsism seriously -- if we assume that is is true and that all valid explanations must conform to it -- it self-destructs.  How does solipsism, taken seriously, really differ from the common-sense rival, realism? The difference is based on no more than a renaming scheme. The solipsists description of the world is in terms of interacting thoughts rather than interacting objects. But the thoughts are real and interact according to the same rules that the realist says govern the interaction of objects.

- Explanations are not judged by how they were derived, but only by their ability, relative to rival explanations, to solve the problems they address.

- Even purely mathematical arguments derive their reliability from the physical and philisophical theories that underpin them.

- If something can kick back, it exists. Kick is when the object affects us in ways that require independent explanations.

- The claim was maid above about the 'inescapable' conclusion that something must be coming throught the second pair of slits to prevent light from reaching the screen from the first. It is not ***logically*** inescapable, for if we were not looking for explanations we could just say that the photons we see behave AS IF something passing throught other slits had deflected them, but that in fact there is nothing there. Similarly, we could have said that our foot rebouded AS IF there was a rock there, but that in fact there was nothing there. (The Inquisition did say that the planets were seen to move as if they adn the Earth were in orbit around the Sun, but in that in fact they moved round the fixed Earth). But if the object of the exercise is to explain the motion of planets, or our foot, or photons, we must adopt the rule that if something behaves as if it existed -- by kicking back -- then one regards that as evidence that it does exist. Shadow photons kick back by interfering with the photons that we see, therefore shadow photons must exist.

  We do not feel the presense of our counterparts in other universes. Nor did the Inquisition feel the Earth moving beneath their feet. And yet, it moves!
  
- We should regard as real those complex entities which, if we did not regard them as real, would complicate our explanations. Its not how hard something kickbacks that makes its existence compelling. What matters is its role in the explanations that the theory provides.

- Physicists trying to avoid the many-worlds conclusion try to explain QM as "No shadow photons exist and what carries the effect of the distant slits on the photon we see is -- nothing. Some sort of action at a distance simply makes photons change course when a distant slit is opened" But this action at a distance is not simple, the photon is affected by distant objects exactly AS IF something were passing through the distant gaps and bounching off distant mirrors etc to intercept the photon at the right time and place. Doing the calculation woudl require the same computational effort of working out the history of a large number of shadow photons. A story that is in in effect about shadow photons necessarily appears in any explanation of the observed effects. The irreducible complexity of the story makes it philosophically untenable to deny that the shadow objects exist.

- Bohms theory also requires the same computations as the what the shadow photons do.

- Logically, reality need not be science-friendly in the sense that evidence for explanations can be found. Reality contains not only evidence, but the means (such as our minds, and our artefacts) of understanding it.

- To the extent that theories are true - that is, they resemble in appropriate respects the concrete or abstract things they refer to - they give reality a new sort of self-similarity, the self-similarity we call knowledge. Some parts resemble other parts. It may be concrete: eg: physical images in a planetarium resembling the night sky, or abstract: when theories are printed in books.

- Science and other forms of knowledge are made possible by a special self-similarity property of the physical world. It was not physicicists that first recognized and studied this property; it was mathematicians and computer scientists. They called it the theory of computation.

- The theory of computation has been studied almost entiresly in the abstract, as a topic in mathematics. This is to miss the point of it. Computers are physical objects and computation is a physical process; what computers can and cannot do is determined by the laws of physics, not by pure mathematics.

- A universal computer is usually defined as an abstract machine that can mimic the computations of any other abstract machine in a certain well-defined class.
  The fact that universal computers are possible and can actually be built, is part of the self-similarity of physical reality that makes the world comprehensible.
  Stated another way, the fact  that virtual reality is possible and that the multiverse has this property, makes science possible.

- What constraints, if any, do the laws of physics impose on the repertoires of virtual-reality generators?
  The laws of physics impose no limit on the range of accuracy of image generators.


- One cannot certify that a virtual reality rendering is accurate, but experience can sometimes show that a rendering is in accurate.  This mirrors the case of theory and experiment in science.
  If the environment is physically possible, rendering it is the equivelent to finding rules for predicting the outcome of all possible experiments that can be performed in that environment.

- If we assume that any virtual reality generator that can in principle be built, can at least be built twice, then it follows that every virtual reality generator running a program is rendering SOME physically possible environment. It may be rendering others things as well, including physically impossible environments, but there is always some possible environment that it is rendering.

- Imagination is a straightforward form of virtual reality. Our "direct" experience of the world throught our senses is virtual reality too, rendered to us by our unconscious minds from sensory data and complex inborn adn acquired theories (ie: programs) about how to interpret them.

- We realists takt the view that reality is out there: objective physical and independent of thwat we believe about it. But we never experience this reality directly. All our experience is VR. And every last scrap of our knowledge -- including our knowledge of the non-physical worlds of logic, math and philosophy -- is encoded in the form of programs for the rendering of those worlds on our brains own VR generator.

- The relationship between "ordinary" reality and virtual reality is part of the deep unexpected structure of the world which this book is about.

- We know from QM that all relevant variables are quantized and thus that the set of possible programs that simulate reality is discrete.  (Each program specifies a particular set of values for physical variables) There are infinetely many possible programs, but each can only contain a finite number of symbols, because symbols are made of matter is reconginzible configurations. (JA: Then are there really an infinite number of possible programs ???)

- The feasibility of a universal virtual-reality  generator depends on the existance of a universal computer - a single machine that can calculate anything that can be calculated.

- Universality was first studied by mathematicians, they were trying to make precise the intuitive notion of computing (or "calculating" or "proving") but they failed to realize that mathematical calculation is a physical process. It is therefore impossible to to determine by mathematical reasoning alone what can or cannot be calculated mathematically.  That depends entirely on the laws of physics. 

- Turing came up with the Universal calculator or Universal Turing maching which he conjecture could calculate anything that could be calculated. eg: everything computable by mathematics.

- Quantum computers will be able to perform computations which no (human) mathematician will ever, even in principle, be able to peform.

- If a question is non-computable, it does not mean that it has no answer or is in any sense ill-defined or ambiguous. It has an answer, it is just that there is physically no way of obtaining the answer.

- Claim: The turing principle: It is possible to build a virtual reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment.
  This is the strongest form of the Turing principle. It says that not only can various parts of reality resemble one another, but that one constructable object can perform the task of describing (mimicking) any other part of the multiverse. This is what makes reality comprehensible.

- The laws of physics are to be comprehensible they must be capable of being embodied in another physical object -- the knower. It is also necessary that physical processes capable of creating such knowledge be physically possible. Such processes are called science.  The laws of physics seem to meet this criteria. B.c the Turing principle seems to be true, the laws of physics can be said to mandate their own comprehensibility. 

- Define something as physically possible as something that actually occurs somewhere in the multiverse.

- There is no logical necessary connection between truth and explanatory power.  So then what justifies relying on theoies that are our best explanations as guides to practical decision-making ?
  This is the modern form of the "problem of induction".

- An "inductivist" is someone who things that the invalidity of the inductive justification is a problem for the foundations of science. eg: there a gap that must be filled, if not by induciton then by something else.  How to justify any conclusion about the future from past evidence.

- Claim justification (which is always tentative) comes from the explanations provided by the relevant scientific theories.
  Only arguement every justifies anything.

- Theories postulating anomalies without explaining them are less likely than their rivals to make true predictions. Theories are postulated to solve problem, therefore any postulate which solves no problem is to be rejected. A good explanation qualified by such a postulate becomes a bad explanation.

- It is an interesting FACT that the physical universe admits proecesses that create knowledge about itself. We should try to explain this fact in the same way as we explain other facts, through explanatory theories. I think that the Turing principle is the appropriate theore in this case. It says that it is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every physically possible environment. If the Turing principle is a law of physics (we I have argued that it is), then we should be surprised that we can form accurate theories about reality, b/c that is just VR in action.

- An argument doesnt begin with "axioms" or end with "conclusions". It starts in the middle with a version that is incomplete, has gaps ambiguities and irrelevancies.
  It is not the same species as a deduction, or the non-existent induction. It is not based on anything or justified by anything. It doesnt have to be, its purpose is to solve problems and to show that a given problem is solved by explanation.
