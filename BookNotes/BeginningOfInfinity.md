# The Beginning of Infinity  (David Deutsch)

- Outstanding! Need to reread. "This is where your heroes come to die"

- Dead Hero List:
  - Empiricism
  - Instrumentalism
  - Spaceship Earth
  - Principle of Mediocrity: Dawkins argement that "Universe beeing is not only queerer than suppose, but it is queerer that we can suppose" 
  - Martin Reese: "could be life and intelligence in forms we cant conceive"
  - Boltzmann Brains 
  - Anthropic Arguments for fine-tuning puzzles
  - Daniel Dennett: who claims in Consousness Explained that qualia dont exist
  - Finitism: the doctrine that only finite abstract entities exist
  - Simulation hypothesis: leads to infinite regress (bad explanation)

- Hero List:
  - Popper
  - Fallibilists



- Books main argument is that all progress (theoretical and practical) come from creating better explanations.
  This activity is both uniquely human and a fundamental fact about reality at the most "impersonal cosmic" level.
  The relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of the central role in _people_ in the cosmic scheme of things.

- Although progress has no end (unbounded) it does have a beginning.

- Example of Cosmic reach of humans: Base metals can be transmuted into gold by stars, and by intelligent beings who understand how stars work, but by nothing else in the universe. (Neutron star Mergers?)

- Scientific theories are _explanations_ of what is out there and how it behaves.

- For most of the history of science it was mistakenly believed that we "derived" scientific theories from the evidence of our senses - a philosophical doctrine known as Empiricism.  In reality scientific theories are guesses -- bold conjectures. Human minds create them by rearranging, combining, altering, and adding to existing ideas with the goal of improving them. Experience is needed, but not as the source of the theories, but in order to choose among those that have already been guessed. This was first understood by Karl Popper.

- Although being dead wrong in terms of where scientific knowledge comes from Empiricism was a great step forward in both the history and philosophy of science.
    - It denied the legitimacy of traditional authorities in seeking answers.
    - However it did this by setting up two new false authorities:
        - "raw" sensory experience
	- "derivation" or induction of science from this sensory experience

- The key to science is that our explanatory theories can be ***improved*** through: conjecture, criticism, and testing.

- Fallibilists expect even their best theories to have some misconceptions included with the truth and so are predisposed to change them for the better.

- It is fallibilism, not the mere rejection of authority, that is essential for the (unlimited) growth of knowledge.

- We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are "theory-laden" and hence just as fallible as our theories.

- We perceive _nothing_ as it really is.  It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.

- What is needed for the sustained rapid growth of knowledge is a tradition of criticism. This happened in the enlightenment which was a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.

- Scientific theories are not derived from experience, but they can be tested be experience.

- Prediction is not, and cannot be the purpose of science.

- Instrumentalism denies explanation exists at all. (It is still very influential especially in QM)

- Just as conflicting predictions are the occasion for experiment and observation; conflicting ideas (in a broader sense) are the occasion for all rational thought and inquiry.

- Define a situation in which we experience conflicting ideas as a ***problem***.

- Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contradictions in reality (Assumption?), every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate.

- "Bad Explanations": The idea that even testable, explanatory theories are not the crucial ingredient that leads to progress. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can account for all the phenomenon they are trying to explain, there is no reason to prefer one over the others (apart from Occam's razor) So a great freedom to make drastic changes (as in eg: ancient mythical explanation for the seasons) is a fundamental flaw. These types of theories are not an effective way to understand the world; even if they make predictions than can be tested.  Whether it is easy to vary an explanation with the same prediction or to vary it to make different predictions, here experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their errors. These easily changed explanation are called "Bad Explanations". If a bad explanation is disproved in favor of another bad explanation, no real progress toward the truth is made. So the scientific mindset is not about testing theories, or even refuting theories, but in seeking better explanations of relevant phenomena. 

- "Good Explanations" are hard to vary. It is only with good explanations that it even matters whether a theory is testable. (Bad explanations are useless even if testable)
   Discoveries good explanations is hard, but the harder they are to find, the harder they are to vary once found.

- Quest for Good explanations is the basic regulating principle of not only science, but the Enlightenment in general.  It is the path (only?) to progress and truth.

- Criterion for reality: a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something.
  Abstract entities can be real and can play a role in causing physical phenomena (see: Hofstader example of prime number domino calculator)

- Occam razor: is a common way of removing arbitrariness of a bad explanation, that can sometimes yield a good one.

- Conjectures are the product of imagination, but imagination can create fiction much more easily than reflect reality.

- The explanation-based conception of science is why we can know so much about ***unfamiliar*** aspects of reality

- The "Reach" of an explanation is its ability to solve problems beyond those that it was created to solved (SUSY with DM and gauge coupling unification)

- Make sense to also speak of the reach of a non-explanatory forms of knowledge ("Rules of thumb")
    - eg: knowledge implicit in genes for biological adaptation)

- To be elaborated on later:  There is something greatly significant about explanation in the cosmic scheme of things.

- Scientific Instruments: correct errors through indirectness that is guided/inspired/designed by theory. Strips away illusions misleading perspectives and gaps.
   It is amazing that object exist that when we observe them take on the apparance, other properties of other objects that are elsewhere are very different.
    (scientific intstruments (and our sensory organs) are examples of these incredible things.
   Explanatory theories tell us how to build and operate devices in exactly the right way to make this miracle work.
   Like conjuring tricks in reverse: these instruments fool our senses into seeing whats really there
   It is ironic that scientific instruments bring us closer to reality when in purely physical terms they only ever separate us further from it.
   (An example that all observation is theory laden)

- To say that we have genuinely obserserved a thing is to say that we have accurately attributed our evidence (which is alawys ultimately inside our own brains) to that thing.
   Scientific truth is when we have accurately attributed physical reality to theory

- The Spaceship Earth metaphore and the Principle of Mediocrity are almost universally accepted anomg scientifically minded people.
  Despite the fact that niavely they argue in oppositie directions:
  	  - Principle of Mediocrity says how typical the earth is
	  - Spaceship Earth emphasizes how special the earth is

   However Truth is:
     -) Humans are cosmologically significant
     -) the Earths biosphere is ***incapable*** of supporting human life

- The biosphere only ever achieves (temporaraly) statbility by constantly neglecting, harming, disabling, and killing individuals. Earth is not a life-support system!
  Almost the entire capacity of the earths "life-support system for humans" has been created _by us_ using our ability to create new knowledge.
  The extent to which we are on a spaceship we are its designers and builders, before humans it was not a vehicle, but a heap of dangerous raw materials

- Biological evolution did not provide us with enough knowledge to survive.
   (Here with differ from most other species which do have all the knowledge they need encoded in their brains "by the biosphere"

- Although our sensec cannot detect neutrinos or quasars or most other significant phenomena in the universe, our brains can understand them

- The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical: it implies that all human abilities, including our special ability to creat new explanations, are necessarily parochial.
   Which implies that science, despite all its successes and spirations would turn out to be inherently parochial and anthropocentric.
   and thus that at some level the universe must be inexplicable

- Any assumption that the world is inexplicable can lead only to Bad Explanations

- There is an intimate connection be explaining the world and contolling it. In the set of all conceivable transformation of physical objects, there are those never happen because they are forbinned by the laws of physics; those that happen spontaneously; and some that are possible given enought knowledge. And these are all the options. So all potential physical transformations are either impossible (excluded by the laws of physics) or possible with the right knowledge.  If there were transformations that technology could never achieve it would be a regularity that is testable in nature, But all regularities have explanations (assumption?) and so the explanation would be the consequence of a law of nature.

- This is ultimately the source of the cosmic importance of poeple, They have the ability to create knowledge which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, but only by universal laws.
  Anything that can create explanatory knowledge has cosmic significance. Astrophysics is incomplete without a theory of people.
    eg: It is not true that the attributes of a supernova in general are independent of the presence or absence of people, or of what these people know and intend.
        Generally, if we want to predict what a star will do we have to know whethere there are any people near it and if so, what knowledge they have and what they might want to do.

    eg: The only phenomena that our best instruments can detect at stellar distances are 1) extreemly bright objects 2) a few things that obscure these objects 3) the effects of certian types of knowedge designed for communication (lasers/radio transmitters etc)

- Using knowledge to sustain life is not unique to humans; but is the basic method which cells use to stay alive. DNA is a coded description of knowledge of ancestral environments. The differnce is what kind of knowledge they use (explanatory vs rule-of-thumb) and how its created (conjecture and criticism vs variation and selection of genes)

- Humans are Universal Constructors: factories for transforming anything into anything.

- Why should only one adaptation (human intelligence, problem solving, knowledge creation) out of the trillions that have been tried have unlimited reach?

- There cannot be intelligence in forms we cant concieve (contra to Martin Reese's claims) If there were some thing that we were qualitatively unable to understand this would be a claim that the world is not explicable and is the same as an appeal to the supernatural.

- Minimum needed to affect change in the Universe is matter, energy and access evidence: the information needed to test scientific theories.

- Access to evidence: As far we know all the constants of nature can be measured here and every fundamental law can be tested here. So everything needed for open-ended knowledge creation is availbe in the earths biosphere. Not one is the Universe full of evidence, it is full of the same evidence everywhere. All people in the Universe face the opportunities.

- In the Universe at large knowledge-friendliness is the rule, not the exception. Or person-friendliness to people who have the relevant knowledge; Death is the rule for people who do not.

- Typical child born today in the US is more likely to die as a result of an astronomincal event than a plane crash.

- Death: an unproblematic state with out creative thought

- There can be no ultimate explaination. Nothing can be explained only in terms of itself. So any purported ultimate explanation will be a bad explanation; it will be easy to vary because it cant answer the question why this foundation and not another.  A implication of this is that the deep an explanation, the more problems it creates.  (JA:Not sure I completely buy this)

- The Continental Enlightenment was impatent for the perfected state, while the British Enlightenment was impatient for institutions that did not stife gradual, continual change and pushed small improvements, unbounded in the future. (Liberal vs Conservative)

- Knowledge is a significant phenomonea in the Universe.  To make almost any prediction about astrophysics one must take a position on what types of knowledge will or will not be present near the phenomonea in question. All explanation of what is out there mention people and knowledge even only implicitly.

- The class of transformations that could happen spontaneously (ie: in the absense of knowledge) is negligibly small compared to those that could be affected by intelligent beings. So, explanations about almost all physically possible phenomena are about how knowledge woule be applied to bring about these phenomena.

- When our brains learn of diverse phenomena in the Universe (eg a quasar), we have physical objects that are extremely differnet (brians and quasars) whose behavior is dominated by totally different physics with the same mathematical and casual structures -- and doing so more accurately over time.  Only knowledge can exhibit this underlying unity.

- Only explanatory knowledge can be universal. (eg: the SETI instrument is precisely adapted to detecting something that has never yet been detected. Biological evolution could never do this)
  Science (explanatory knowledge) can conjecture the existence of something, calculate its implications, and then construct an instrument to detect it. Non-explanatory knowledge cannot cross the conceptual gap that conjecture does

- Humans and knowledge is not only objectively significant, they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature -- the only ones whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding everything of fundamental importance.  Eg: the behaviour of humans wrt a champagne bottle in a SETI refrigerator depends on the existence of life in other solar systems. Simliar proxy behavious in other scientific labs.
  Consider also how completely differnet the evolution of an environment with and without the presense of a tiny sliver of knowledge.
  Almost all regions of the universe are just waiting doing nothing at all, which if the right knowledge ever reached it, instantly and irrevocably busrt into a radically differnet type of physical activity.

- Both the principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth idea are fundamentally parochial and mistaken. Science (the least parochial perspective available to us) implies that people are the most significant entitites in the cosmic scheme of things.  They are not supported by their environment, but support themselves by creating knowledge.

- Apart from the thoughts of people, the only process known to create knowledge is biological evolution. However the knowledge it creates (apart from via people) is inherently bounded and parochial. 

- Good adaptation and good explanations are hard to vary while still retaining thier function.

- Error Correction: Once they are physically embodied DNA and memes in human brains tend to cause themselves to remain so. This information is very unlikely to come into existence other than through the errorc correcting process of evolution and thought

- In any good explanation of the origin of biological adaptation God cannot play the role assigned by creationism.  Who created God ? The answer can only be a bad explanation.

- The existence of an unsolved problem in physics is not more evidence for supernatural explanation than the existence of an unsolved crime is that a ghost committed it.

- The idea that similiar laws of physics can be expected to give rise to similar environments in undermined by the very existence of fine-tuning.

- Boltzmann Brains are bad explanations. At any given instant, the theory predicts that we are going to be killed in the next picosecond and is hence refuted by observation a picosecond later.

- Anthropic explanations are attemptiong to account for purposeful structure in terms of one single act of selection. This is unlike evolution, and cannot work. It is too easy an explanation. The solution of the the fine-tuning puzzel is going to be in terms of an explanation that will specifically explain what we observe.

- Scientific discovery is profoundly unpredictable despite the fact that it is determined by the laws of physics. Before a discovery, not predictive process could reveal the content of the discovery; if it could it would be that discovery.

- There is no better desteny for a theory that to point the way to a more comprehensive thoery to which it lives on as a limiting case.j

- Progress is made by creatively varying the ***_explanations_*** of a theory, not the predictions.

- Our brans are computers whiech we can use to learn about things beyond the physical world, including pure mathematical abstractions.
  These mathematical abstractions are not possible objects of any observation, and yet we come to know about them.
  (Plato concluded that this knowledge must come from the supernatural) However our knowledge of these abstract entities actually comes from conjecture, critisism, and seeking good explanations.

- Common claim: "You can't derive an ought from an is, therefore morality connot be justified by reason"  True, but you also cant derive a factual theory from an is either.
  Factual evidence and moral maximums are independent, but factual and moral ***_explanations_*** are not. Factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations.
   eg: Sucess at making factual discoveries implies many values that the scientists has to commit to.
         - Value of truth, good explanations, and be open to ideas and change.

- Reductionism and Holism are both mistakes. Explanations do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level the most fundamental. Explanations at any level can be fundamental.

- The Jump to Universality is a tendency of gradually improving systems to undergo a sudden large increase in functionality, becoming universial in some domain.
   It has a typical transitions:
    Before the jump there are specialized tools for each use case
    After the jump once customizes (or specializes or programs) a universal object

- There is more of a reason to model the brain as a computer then as a steam engine:
  A computer, but not a steam engine, is a universal simulator.
  Expecting a computer to do whatever neurons can is not a metaphor.


- There is no such thing as an universal analogue computer. Analogue computers cant do error correction (every value in an analogue could be correct) and without error correction, the growth of knowledge is bounded. So all universal computers are digital and all use error-correction. All jumps to universality orrur in digital systems. eg: Spoken languages build words out of a finit set of elementary sounds.

- All known jumps to universality have be done by humans except one: DNA

- Initially the genetic code was evolving along with everything else in the organism, but became a point where the code itself stopped evolving, despite the fact that the organisms continued to.
  When the DNA stopped evolving it was only coding for single-celled organisms. Despite that all organisms today have been based on exactly the same alphabet of bases, and three-base "words".
  Considereed as a language, the genetic code has displayed phenomenal reach.
  DNA might have been the first universality to exist,
  We do not know why DNA which evolved to describe bacteria has enough reach to describe dinosaurs and humans. 

- AI must be possible in principle beacause a universal computer is a universal simulator

- In Consciousness Explained (some refer to it as Consciousness Denied) Dennet claims that qualia dont exist.  To deny them is a bad explanation.

- If you cant program it, you dont understand it

- Judging whether something is really a genuine AI will always depend on explanations of how it works.

- A chatbot responds as though it had created knowledge in composing a response to a question, in reality the knowledge was created earlier and elsewhere.

- The feild of AGI has made no real progress because there is an unsolved philosophical problem at its heart: we dont understand how creativity works.
   Claim: One that is solved, programming AI will not be difficult.

- Mathematicians realized centuries ago that it is possible to work consistently and usefull with infinity.

- Case against Finitism: Problem, is there a real largest natural number or not ? Finitists have to deny the "law of the excluded middle" ie: A or ~A.
  Finitism is intrumentalism applied to mathematics. It is a principled rejection of explanation. All access to abstract (and physical) entitites, finite or infinite is via theory.

- Universality of Reason: All branches of philosophy, science, and mathematics have inherent limitations. But there is no bound to reason.  Believing in a bound on the domain of reason is equivalent to the beilief in the supernatural.

- The best explanation of anything eventually involves universality, and therefore infinity.

- Whenever we refer to infinity we are making use of the infinite reach of some idea. Whenever an idea of infinity makes sense, it is because there is an explanation of why some finite set of rules for manipulating finite symbols refers to something infinite.  (This underlies our knowledge of everything else as well!)

- There are uncountably many orders of infinity, each too large to be put into one-to-one correspondence with the lower ones. (Is the number of order of infinity the same as any one of the infinities?)

- When we have unbounded growth of knowledge we are always (and forever) just scratching the surface.

- The atributes of probable or improbable, rare or common, typical or untypical have literally no meaning in when comparing infinite sets of natural numbers. This is bad news for anthropic arguments.
  None of the anthropic-reasoning theories that have been proposed provide any measure. Most are little more than speculations "What if there were universes with different parameters?"

- The set of all functions is uncountably infinite, while the set of all programs is merely countably inifite => almost all mathematical truths have no proofs. They are unprovable truths. Most of all mathematical statements are undecidable: there is no proof that they are true and no proof that they are false. Each of them is either True or False, but there is no way of using physical objects (brains or computers) to discover which is which.  All undecidable statements are directly or indirectly about infinite sets. To finitists, this is beacuse of the meaninglessness of these statements. To Deutsch it is further proof that abstractions exist objectively, these statemets cannot merely be a convenient way of describing the behaviour of some physical system.  Interestingly, very few questions are known to be undecidable, even though most are.

- There is nothing mathematically special about the undecidable questions. They are destinguished by ***_physics_** only. Different physical laws would make differnt things infinite (?), different things computable, different truths (scientific and mathematical) knowable.  It is only the laws of physics that determine which abstract entities and relationships are modelled by physical objects such as mathematicians brains, computers, and sheets of paper. Our knowledge of whethere a proposition is true or false ***_always_*** depends on knowledge about how physical objects behave; the mathematical proposition is independent of physics, but the proof of the proposition is a matter of physics only. There is no such thing as abstractly proving something (just as there is no such thing as abstractly knowing something)

 All mathematical truth is absolutely necessary and transcendent, but all knowledge is generate by physical properties, and its scope and limitations are conditioned by the laws of nature

  #ConnectionOfMathAndPhysics 

- A computation or proof is a physical process in which objects (computers or brians) physically model or instantiate abstract entities (numbers or equations) and mimic their properties. This is our window on the abstract. Every mathematical proof depends on our knowing the rules that govern these physical objects. Contrary to what most mathematicians believe,  proof theory can never be made into a branch of mathematics, it is a science (computer science) 

- The point of mathematics is to understand  (explain) abstract entities. Proof is like observation in science, mainly a way of ruling out false explanations.  Mathematics (like all fields) does not seek random truths but good explainations.  The motivation for seeking a perfectly secure foundation is mistaken, a form of justificationism.

- Another potential fine-tuning in the laws of physics: They support computational universality: so human brains can predict and explain the behaviour or very un-human objects (eg: quasars)
  If the laws of physics depended on non-computable functions (most functions are non-computable) we could not make predictions, and hence could not exist.
  So there is something infinitely special about the laws of physics as we actually find them. They are fine-tuned for computation, prediction, and explanation.
  "The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences"  (This problem seems to attract bad explanations)
  eg: simulation hypothesis


- Simulation hypothesis: It is the very nature of computational universality that if we and our world were composed of software, we would have no means of understanding the real physics -- the physics of the simulator. So the simulation hypothesis entails giving up on explanation in science.

- P!=NP says there are classes of mathematical questions whose answers can be verfified easily once you have them, but that cannot be computed easily in the first place by a universal computure. Almost all researchers in computing theory are sure that this conjecture is true.

- Conjecture: If a question is interesting, then the problem is soluble. However, fallibilism tells us that we can be mistaken about what is interesting.

  Corollaries:
	- Inherently insoluble problems are inherently uninteresting. 
	- In the long run, the distinction between what is interesting and uninteresting is not a matter of subjective taste but an objective fact.
	- The interesting problem of why every probem that is interesting is also soluble is itself soluble.

- We currently dont know why the laws of physics seem fine-tuned; we dont know why various forms of universality exist; we do not know why the world is explicable. But eventually we shall, and when we do there will still be infinitely more left to explain.

- Computation: a physical process that instantiates the properties of some abstract entity.

- The property of infinite sequences is that every element is exceptionally close to the beginning.
