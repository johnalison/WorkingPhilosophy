# The Beginning of Infinity  (David Deutsch)

- Outstanding! Need to reread. "This is where your heroes come to die"

- Dead Hero List:
  - Empiricism
  - Instrumentalism

- Hero List:
  - Popper
  - Fallibilists

- Books main argument is that all progress (theoretical and practical) come from creating better explanations.
  This activity is both uniquely human and a fundamental fact about reality at the most "impersonal cosmic" level.
  The relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of the central role in _people_ in the cosmic scheme of things.

- Although progress has no end (unbounded) it does have a beginning.

- Example of Cosmic reach of humans: Base metals can be transmuted into gold by stars, and by intelligent beings who understand how stars work, but by nothing else in the universe. (Neutron star Mergers?)

- Scientific theories are _explanations_ of what is out there and how it behaves.

- For most of the history of science it was mistakenly believed that we "derived" scientific theories from the evidence of our senses - a philosophical doctrine known as Empiricism.  In reality scientific theories are guesses -- bold conjectures. Human minds create them by rearranging, combining, altering, and adding to existing ideas with the goal of improving them. Experience is needed, but not as the source of the theories, but in order to choose among those that have already been guessed. This was first understood by Karl Popper.

- Although being dead wrong in terms of where scientific knowledge comes from Empiricism was a great step forward in both the history and philosophy of science.
    - It denied the legitimacy of traditional authorities in seeking answers.
    - However it did this by setting up two new false authorities:
        - "raw" sensory experience
	- "derivation" or induction of science from this sensory experience

- The key to science is that our explanatory theories can be ***improved*** through: conjecture, criticism, and testing.

- Fallibilists expect even their best theories to have some misconceptions included with the truth and so are predisposed to change them for the better.

- It is fallibilism, not the mere rejection of authority, that is essential for the (unlimited) growth of knowledge.

- We never know any data before interpreting it through theories. All observations are "theory-laden" and hence just as fallible as our theories.

- We perceive _nothing_ as it really is.  It is all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.

- What is needed for the sustained rapid growth of knowledge is a tradition of criticism. This happened in the enlightenment which was a rebellion against authority in regard to knowledge.

- Scientific theories are not derived from experience, but they can be tested be experience.

- Prediction is not, and cannot be the purpose of science.

- Instrumentalism denies explanation exists at all. (It is still very influential especially in QM)

- Just as conflicting predictions are the occasion for experiment and observation; conflicting ideas (in a broader sense) are the occasion for all rational thought and inquiry.

- Define a situation in which we experience conflicting ideas as a ***problem***.

- Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contradictions in reality (Assumption?), every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate.

- "Bad Explanations": The idea that even testable, explanatory theories are not the crucial ingredient that leads to progress. Whenever a wide range of variant theories can account for all the phenomenon they are trying to explain, there is no reason to prefer one over the others (apart from Occam's razor) So a great freedom to make drastic changes (as in eg: ancient mythical explanation for the seasons) is a fundamental flaw. These types of theories are not an effective way to understand the world; even if they make predictions than can be tested.  Whether it is easy to vary an explanation with the same prediction or to vary it to make different predictions, here experimental testing is almost useless for correcting their errors. These easily changed explanation are called "Bad Explanations". If a bad explanation is disproved in favor of another bad explanation, no real progress toward the truth is made. So the scientific mindset is not about testing theories, or even refuting theories, but in seeking better explanations of relevant phenomena. 

- "Good Explanations" are hard to vary. It is only with good explanations that it even matters whether a theory is testable. (Bad explanations are useless even if testable)
   Discoveries good explanations is hard, but the harder they are to find, the harder they are to vary once found.

- Quest for Good explanations is the basic regulating principle of not only science, but the Enlightenment in general.  It is the path (only?) to progress and truth.

- Criterion for reality: a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something.

- Occam razor: is a common way of removing arbitrariness of a bad explanation, that can sometimes yield a good one.

- Conjectures are the product of imagination, but imagination can create fiction much more easily than reflect reality.

- The explanation-based conception of science is why we can know so much about ***unfamiliar*** aspects of reality

- The "Reach" of an explanation is its ability to solve problems beyond those that it was created to solved (SUSY with DM and gauge coupling unification)

- Make sense to also speak of the reach of a non-explanatory forms of knowledge ("Rules of thumb")
    - eg: knowledge implicit in genes for biological adaptation)

- To be elaborated on later:  There is something greatly significant about explanation in the cosmic scheme of things.
