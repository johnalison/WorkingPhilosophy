# Powers and Thrones (Dan Jones)

- Very good. Learned a lot. Fast read.

- Great forces beyond our control: Climate change, mass migration, pandemic disease, technological change, and global network, sound like very modern or even postmodern concern, but they shaped the medival world too.

- it is important to recognize how similar we are to medieval people.

- For much of their history Romans where blessed with good weather.

- The underpinning of Roman military hegemony was the empires ability to absorb defeat, escalate conflict, and exact pitiless regenge; Rome lost many battles but previous few wars.

- overwheleming military power and reach alone did not distinguish Rome from other broadly contemporaneous superpowers of the classical world (eg: Macedonian empire, Persian empires and China). What made rome so dominate in the Mediterranean world and beyond was the fact that overwhelming armed force developed in tune with a sophisticated civic machinery: a mesh of state-of-the-art social, cultural, and legal systems that Romans considered to be virtuous in and of themselves.

- The root purpose of the Roman empire was to funnel wealth to be spent in Rome: in that sense it was a racket based on rampant exploitation.

- There have been a few handful in recorded history of true "slave states" in which slavery permeated every facet of society, and on which an entire economy and culture was built. Rome was one.

- A large part of the western attachment to slavery sprang from the fact that it had been indivisible from Romes swaggering glory.

- For some people the collapse of the western Roman empire was a seismic event, for others it would have registered barely if at all.

- Rome was the historical foundation on which everything in the Middle ages awas built.
