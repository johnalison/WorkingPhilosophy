# Powers and Thrones (Dan Jones)

- Very good. Learned a lot. Fast read.

- Great forces beyond our control: Climate change, mass migration, pandemic disease, technological change, and global network, sound like very modern or even postmodern concern, but they shaped the medival world too.

- it is important to recognize how similar we are to medieval people.

- For much of their history Romans where blessed with good weather.

- The underpinning of Roman military hegemony was the empires ability to absorb defeat, escalate conflict, and exact pitiless regenge; Rome lost many battles but previous few wars.

- overwheleming military power and reach alone did not distinguish Rome from other broadly contemporaneous superpowers of the classical world (eg: Macedonian empire, Persian empires and China). What made rome so dominate in the Mediterranean world and beyond was the fact that overwhelming armed force developed in tune with a sophisticated civic machinery: a mesh of state-of-the-art social, cultural, and legal systems that Romans considered to be virtuous in and of themselves.

- The root purpose of the Roman empire was to funnel wealth to be spent in Rome: in that sense it was a racket based on rampant exploitation.

- There have been a few handful in recorded history of true "slave states" in which slavery permeated every facet of society, and on which an entire economy and culture was built. Rome was one.

- A large part of the western attachment to slavery sprang from the fact that it had been indivisible from Romes swaggering glory.

- For some people the collapse of the western Roman empire was a seismic event, for others it would have registered barely if at all.

- Rome was the historical foundation on which everything in the Middle ages awas built.

- (5 Century AD) Although Rome would live on largely untouched in the east, where it thrived in mutant form as a Greek-speaking Byzantium, the future of the Roman west now lay in the hans of newcomers. The age of the barbarian had dawned.

- The antique world can be said to have crumbled -- and the Middle Ages begun -- on the banks of the Volga in the year AD 370. In that year there appeared crowds of people known as the Huns, who had left their homelands 1000s of miles away on the steppe north of China. There origins are sketchy, but their effect was profound. They were what we call today climate migrants or refugees.

- In 370 it was not the Huns that were the problem, but the people they had displaced. A climate emergency in Asia fed a secondary migrant crisis in eastern Europe.

- One the policy of admitting vast numbers of refugees into the empire had been set, it proved impossible to reverse. Thrace slowly became home to thousands of disaffected and mistreated Gothic migrants. The Balkans were becoming a tinderbox.

- Eight hundred years had passed since Rome had last been sacked. Celts in 387 BC and Visigothis in 410 AD. The terrible symbolism of an assult on a world superpower far outweighed the immediate physical damage done. The Goths struck at the heart of the Roman Empire, leaving scars that only hardened and deepened as the years went by.

- Mass migration, rightly or wrongly, stirs fears and loathing, for as the history of the Western Roman Empire makes abundantly clear, it has the power to turn worlds upside down.

- In a single day, Carthage, the might city for which the Roman Republic had founght the Punic Wars for 100 years was severed from the Empire.  The entire Roman economy depended on Carthaginian grain exports.

- Byzantium survived for centuries until it was ravaged by crusaders and later consumed by the Ottomans -- an event that heralded the end of the Middle Ages.

- The Roman Empire had once been a superspreader of classical learning across vast territories. But as it fell to pieces in the west and became ever-more doctrinally obsessed in the east, it bacame an active blocker to knowledge, and the transmission of ancient learning throughtout the empire began to fail.

- Between the 6C and the first begininngs of the Renaissance in the late 13C, the scientific and rational insights of the ancient world were forgotten or suppressed in the west.

- 536: Across the world the sun dimmed, the sky darkened to a murky gloom and the temperatures dropped appreciably, much as happens during a solar eclipse. The gloom was probably the result of a massive volcanic eruption, perhaps in North America.  One of the sharpest environmental crises in human history. As a result the worlds climate changed for as much as a decade. Temperatures fell by at least 2C globally and summers effectively disappeared.

- The Arab conquest of Syria in 632-642 was one of the most astonishing accomplishments of its age.

- With the exception of Spain, Portugal and Sicily, almost every major territory that was captured by early medieval Islamic armies retained, and still retains today, an Islamic identity and culture.

- Its absolutism which became increasingly pronounced during Islams early medieval history, would come to be its attraction, its strength, and its inherent menace to those who had not yet submitted to its teachings.

- Muslim soldiers who formed the conquering armies were largely kept separate form the populace garrisoned in military towns and paid a stipend funded by taxation. There were not rewarded with tracts of land or confiscated estate, a policy that helped reduce civil tension in the short term, and in the long term meant that Muslim armies did not blend over a couple of generations into the local population, in the Roman fashion.

- Pragmatic acceptance of local practices -- at least in the short term -- has always been an effective way of pursuing military expansion without provoking long insurgencies.

- The Byzantium empire had perfected a deadly, oil-based jelly know variously as Roman fire, marine fire, artificial fire, or Greek fire. It was a game-changing weapons system, and a military secrete that the Byzantine state would gaurd closely for 500 years, so closely indeed that the knowledge of how to manufacture and deploy it was ultimately forgotten.

- Many historians see the failure of the second Arab siege of Constantinople as a turning point in Western history: the moment when the spread of the first Islamic armies toward the Balkans was halted.

- Around the year 700 the Arabian leader ordered that public servants across the Islamic world should use only Arabic. This simple administrative change was in fact a moment of juddering cultural importance in the history of the Islamic world -- for it ensured that there would be an Islamic world in perpetuity, rather than a short-lived federation of former Roman and Persian territories ruled over by a thin monotheistic elite.

- The defeate of the Arabs at the battle of Tours saved all of Europe form Islamification and preveneted an alternative history from unfolding.

- Many of the late-medieval advances of the European Renaissance would have been impossible without the preservation of classical knowledge and technology from across the world in Islamic institutions like the House of Wisdom.

- One of the great and lasting stories of the Middle Ages is one of increasing ignorance and hostility between the Islamic east and the Christian west.
