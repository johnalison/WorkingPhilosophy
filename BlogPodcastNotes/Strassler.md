- Fusion is a fascinating process, because all four of the famous forces of nature are needed. [The fifth, the Higgs force, plays no role, though as is so often the case, the Higgs field is secretly crucial.] In a sense, it’s a poster child for our understanding of how the cosmos works. Consider sunshine:

   - We need gravity to hold the Sun together, and to crush its center to the point that its temperature reaches well over ten million degrees.
   - We need electromagnetism to produce the light that carries energy to the Sun’s surface and sunshine to Earth.
   - We need the strong nuclear force to make protons and neutrons, and to combine them into other simple nuclei such as deuterium, tritium and helium.
   - We need the weak nuclear force to convert the abundant protons into neutrons (along with a positron [i.e. an anti-electron] and a neutrino.)
