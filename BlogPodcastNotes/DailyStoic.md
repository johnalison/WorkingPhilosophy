-  Marcus Aurelius, frustrated with some obnoxious thing that was consuming his days, once asked himself.
    “You’re afraid of death, because you won’t be able to do this anymore?”
    Because death is real. You do not have unlimited time.

- it is unconscionable to fill up body bags while you get your education one mistake at a time
  Jim Mattis

- "Stoicism tries to get its students to approach the troubles of other people like a good doctor would. Veteran doctors are very compassionate, and they give their all to their patients. But they don’t get emotional about it. They might have done so when they were first getting started, but experience tends to turn them into natural stoics in their professional lives. That’s one way to think about Stoicism: it’s an effort to gain, by the study of philosophy, some of the traits and immunities that would otherwise be the natural result of long experience. The study of stoicism is kind of a surrogate for the passage of time."  - Ward Farnsworth



- "What to do?"  Is the wrong question, Epictetus said. Instead, it was better to ask how to be adaptable to circumstances.
