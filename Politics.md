- Power of thinking about diminishing returns not respected by enough democrats/liberals. Worth getting problems 90% solved; the extra 10% is often not worth the cost, politically

- Socialism for needs, Capitalism for wants.

    like the right has forgot the former, and the left has forgot the
    latter.
