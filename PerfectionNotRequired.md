# Perfection Not required, effective self-improvement critical 

- Seek out feedback loops

  > these give an easy path to self-improvement. However its important
    that the noise is low (eg: poker not for decision theory). Would
    like to put this to use with glimpses/mindfulness.

- If you need to specialize, should specialize in being the best version of yourself.

  > Much better/more-productive than some esoteric or politics or
    sports trivia.  Positive feedback loop

- Inch-by-inch progress is made. 

  > “Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is no small thing” - Zeno.
  > Related is concept of compounding interest. Get better at getting better.

- “Begin Again”

  > Important skill that is underappreciated, Under-utilized. Useful
    as a mantra anytime there is a daunting task.

- Think of life as one long training/learning period.

  > Use life as a “sparing partner” that we are using to improve. It
    is important to be clear minded and respond to what is happening,
    but no need to take it personally.

  > Example: The American experiment. Country far from perfect when
    started (deeply flawed) with time the notion of citizen
    improved/expanded to be "more perfect".

- Anti-fragility:

  > Something is fragile if it easily breaks, robust if it does not
  break under stress, and anti-fragile if it gets stronger or improves
  under stress.  Lots of stoic thoughts about how to improve under
  stress.  Important to be able to try many low cost experiments and
  iterate.  Think about what makes you anti-fragile. and where and how
  you can fail.  How can you optimize worse case scenarios?

  > Example of Anti-fragility (Jocko): Stresses (eg: not sleeping
    enough) actually makes him a better performer. More alert, more
    responsive, emotionally engaged.

- Law of diminishing returns.

   > Example of 80/20.  Get the low hanging fruit.  Acquire breath of
   knowledge at the 80/20 level.  Then choose what long sloughs to
   fight.

- Learn to forget: (especially in others) 
- Revise your judgements 
- Be able to forget: Memory is unruly and stupid. It leaves us in lurch when needed and puts its nose into places its not wanted. Cultivate good habits of memory, it can make life heaven or hell.
