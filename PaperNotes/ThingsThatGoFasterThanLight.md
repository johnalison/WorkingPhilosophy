# Things that go faster than light

- The difficulty is quite general. In order to transmit a message there must be some change of motion. And nature seems to have conspired to make it impossible to send a change faster than light.

- the very existence of long-range radio communi­ cation depends on the fact that radio waves in the ionized layers of the upper atmosphere have phase velocities great­ er than the speed of light. This is what enables them to be reflected by the ionosphere and to connect transmitters with receivers that are over the horizon.
