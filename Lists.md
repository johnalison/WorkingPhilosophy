   - Crypto 
   - Immigration 
   - Calories vs Carbs
   - sleeping
   - longevity 
   - electric cars
   - going to mars
   - cryonics
   - Never talk to the cops

# Why Now is interesting

- Multi-Planetary Species
- AI revolutions
- Brain-Machine Interface 
- Longevity
- Ability to kill all of humanity (nukes / bio) 
- Genetic Re-engineering 
- Close to last generation that uses sex to reproduce
- The precipice:
  > Claim that we now possess the ability to destroy ourselves without the wisdom to avoid doing so.
  > => high probability this will happen. 
  > If we can avoid total destruction in next couple 100 years, we will have  the ability to "live forever" 
- Now the principles of Darwinian evolution are evolving. 
  > conception through sex disappearing
- We are living through a revolution: Information revolution. We have internalize it so dont think about it so much. With our current political situation: Could we be "paying the tab" for all the great 21st century tech? This information age revolution is different because a core principle is the perpetually accelerating innovation. Society does not have time to "catch up" with the new world order and adapt.
- The man of knowledge in our time has a burden he never imaged, the overproduction of truth that cannot be consumed. Use to believe that truth was slim and elusive and once we found it our troubles would be over. Now we are choking in truth. (Denial of Death)
- Scientific revolution may well end history and start somethign different (Reason that now is different) 


# Crazy things scientists used to believe
- Sperm is little homunculus
- Darwin wrote that emotional imbalance could cause fuzzy hair.
- Phrenology measure mental essences as bumps on the skull
- Infants prior to the 1980s where not anesthetized during major surgery, on belief that couldnt feel pain.
- Early plastics were designed to look like wood. 

# Things where experts disagree
Can tell where we don't really understand problems when experts wildly disagree. In these cases understand BOTH sides. Silly to pick one. 

- Interpretations of QM
- Fermi Paradox
- Future of AI / AGI
- Future of Brain-Machine-Interface
- Hierarchy Problem
- CC 
- Universe as Simulation
- Free will ? 
- Consensus 
- Cryonics



# Mental Models

- Bias Variance Trade off
- Lepton Fake Factor
- Closure Test
- Circle of Competencies
  > Understand/be aware of what you dont know and what you are not an expert it.
  > Probe to find where the limits of the "experts".
- First principles thinking
  > Exactly what physics trains for. 
  > Look for moving parts, knowns/unknowns and see how things fit together.  
  > Ignore the stories that you cant understand. 
  > Doubt everything that you cant get to from axioms.
- The map is not the territory
  > Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model.
  > Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information.
  > Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
  > Physics Examples: EFTs.
- Law of diminishing returns
  > Example of 80/20.
  > Get the low hanging fruit.
  > Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
  > Then choose what long sloughs to fight. 
- 2nd order thinking
  > Consider the consequences of the consequences of your action.
  > Obviously want to think to as high an order as possible.
  > Developing trust is a great example (Be reliable ! See dont lie and be the good).
- Inversion 
  > "Invert, always invert" - Jacobi

  > Avoiding stupidity often easier than seeking brilliance

  > Index funds (Vanguard) can be seen as form on inversion
     > Easy to avoid poor returns 
     > Easy to lower known fees
     > Together these outperform almost everything

  > Inversion Steps: 
     > 1) Identify Problem, 
     > 2) Define Objective, 
     > 3) Identify forces that support change toward objective, 
     > 4) Identify forces that impede change toward objective, 
     > 5) Strategize. Add forces in 3) and remove from 4) 

  > Most people stop at 3), Inversion is all about finding problems that make things worse, and avoid doing them.

  > Ford bough scrapped Ford cars to find out wihch parts DIDNT fail.  Those could be made a lot cheaper. (Inversion) 

- Occams Razor (William of Ockham) 
- Hanlons Razor 
  > Most people doing wrong are not bad people trying to be malicious. 
  > Stupidity far more common than malice.

- Proving things about poly-nominals usual much easier than proving things about integers: Poly-Nominals have roots and can be differentiated. 
   (Is there a notion of differentiation that can be applied to integers? Primes? ) (Fearless Symmetry)

- Sturgeons Law: 90% of everything is crap. Look for the 10%.


# Protocols

- **Stoic Test Challenge**
- When things are bad...__*"GOOD"*__
- Steph mad at me
- H getting on my nerves
- Meetings
- Reading papers
- Reading books
- When feeling jealous of someone ask: "What can I learn from this person?"
- When you (as a leader) have someone stepping up and taking charge and you start to feel intimidated. Ask: 
    > "Why am I intimidated by this situation? "

    > Its probably your ego. You are being a weak leader. 
 - When you are too embarrassed to ask for help: Thats a little knock at the door saying "You're insecure!"


# What do you we do now that will be totally replaced in 100 years?

- Combustion Engines
- Charcoal Grills
- Driving
- Eating insane amounts of sugar
- War on drugs


# What important truth do very few people agree with you on?

- Cryonics could be the most important thing you do. 
- Value in Crypto
- Can only eat once a day
- Power of meditation / Stoic challenge
- Atomic weapons are currently our number one problem
- Dentistry ill founded. food we eat now root cause of misaligned teeth.  
- Profoundly erroneous truism, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them" - whitehead
- Plants domensticated humans, not the other way around
- Basis for demcocarsy equal rights movement is religous not scientific 


# Montras

- Is this essential ?
- What is this ?
- What if this is it ?
- Where is the self ?
- What if there are no problems, problems to who ?
- Will this help be get what I want ?
- Where is the truth in this ?
- Will this matter in a month ?
- Am I suffering? Is this necessary?
- Is this reason (ally) ? or is this my mind (enemy) ?
- What if nothing needs to be changed ?
- What are the relevant priors? 
- What would have to be true for this to be right ?
> Is this one of the unnecessary things?


# People I look up to (North stars)

- Charlie Munger
- Joe Kroll: Understands what he works on deeply. Great mentor to students: Physics and (HEP) politics. Doesn't take himself too seriously (others often think he does). Commands respect. Good memory. Dependable/reliable.  Family first.
- Elliot Lipeles
- Dominick Olivito: Reliable, Sensible, Honest, Realistic, Can execute, quiet. Radiates confidence, emotional detachment.
- Daniel Froideveux
- Elon Musk
- Stoics
- Jocko W
- Bertrand Russel
- Steven Pinker
- Jamie Saxon
- Tom of Tom and Deb

- Sam Harris: All around
- Joe Rogan: Ablility to relate to people
- Mark: Business focus.
- Richard Heart : Insights 
- Patrick Bryant : Reading / Insights
- Tanmay - Breath of knowladge
- Roy+Markus+Reinhard - Physics teaching.
- Wes Baker: Honesty, loyalty.  Someone that can be depended upon.
- Dad : Knows what he likes / Reads a lot / Informed / Scarified to spend time with family  
- Mom : Hard working / good people sense /
- Grandma Big Cars: Effective / reliable / organized / moral
- Karol Krizka: has the nature that when something comes up (no matter how big or small) he digs deeply to the root cause to fix or improve the problem. Was especially apparent to me when working with him on FTK commissioning. Leeds to deep knowledge in various areas that are likely to come up again. Builds expertise in debugging technical problems (motivates the building of a Linux machine). Example of compounding returns.
"How you do everything is how you do anything"  
- Ira and Roy: often know how to get to the point, clarify
- Markus: very knowledgeable, good points
- Jeff: Also very insightful
- Barry: very professional
- Dan Carlin: Nice takes on History.  
  - History more than facts, there are lessons to draw from. 
  - People of the past just as smart as we are. 
  - Now could be different. (This generation not abused as children. Manage to make ware obsolete?)
  - Highlights when worlds collide.
  - Highlights when people look back at much more impressive and destroyed civilisations/cities. eg Xenephon and the Assyrians.
  - Thinks about how history will look back on us.
  - Lots of analogies to more current affairs.
- Roger Penrose: Orthogonal thinker. Genius. Good Physics taste. Clearly an outside in the field.  (Despite the noble prize!)

# Paradoxes                                                             

- Paradox of the Mind: When we look, mind seems totally insubstantial, yet everything we experience is a modification of the mind. 
- We spend most of our time trying to change What Is into What Should Be.  Turns out that this change is often easiest after we truly accept what is.
- We are identical with one of the greatest mysteries in the Universe. In a sense its the only thing we know, can know. In another, it is one of the last great unknowns (to science).
- Incompleteness Theorem:     "There is more to truth that provability in the deductive system" /     Arithmetic truth out runs formal provability / Truth values of undecidable statements can be decided by embedding them in a richer structure. Also common practice of mathematicians, eg: invoke structures far richer than a statement they are trying to prove. /   - No consistent theory can prove its own consistency /
- How can humans, physical organisms in a physical universe, have knowledge of a casually inert realm of abstract objects?
- Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.

# What will be seen as right/wrong in future

- Cryonics (Right)
- Social Media (Wrong)
- Driving (Wrong)
- Sugar Consumption 
- Meditation


# Things I want to learn 

- Brazilian Jiu-Jitzu 
- CPR
- How to swim

# Who/what are we:
- Our brains are powerful computers but with arcane operating systems 
- Emotions (Algorithms) very fast efficient, but often used out of context.
- Quickly becoming gods (or racing to event new ones (AI)) without wisdom. 
- Animals with rationality - the tool that may allow us to transcend our situation
- Optimism and hubris is built into our operating systems 
- Mans self-consciousness makes man a small god in nature, yet at the same time man is a worm and food for worms. This duality is a painful contradiction. Lower animal spared this contradiction. (Q: Are we spared other painful contradictions from our limited knowledge/being ? (Becker)
- We are gods with anuses (Becker)
- The basic insight of psychology for all time: Man is a union of opposites, of self-consciousness and physical body. (Becker)
- When evolution gave man a self an inner symbolic world of experience, it split him in two, gave him added burden. This burden seems the price that had to be paid in order to attain more life, experience and self-consciousness. (Becker)

# What we should be teaching kids:
- Importance of Filtering. (Especially in today's world) Knowing what, when and how to filter is critical to being productive. Knowing what to believe, seeing truth.
- How to google. 
- Meditation/controlling your emotions. 
- Self-motivation 
- Self-improvement. 
- Game theory

- Give more than I take
- Learn. Connect dots. Probe unknown.
- Understand what is under my control and what is not.

- The most one can achieve is a certain relaxedness an openness to experience that makes him less of a driven burden on others.(Becker)



# What are my values?
   - Dont Lie
   - Look for lasting change (systems not goals) 
   - Golden rule (veil of ignorance) 
   - Strict with self/lenient with other
   - Increase freedom/liberty when possible
   - Equality of opportunity
   - ...
