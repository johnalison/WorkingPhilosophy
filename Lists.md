# Things Ive changed my mind on

   - benefits of agriculture revolution
   - Worth it to fund AMS 
   - Lying 
   - Meditation
   - Gun control 
   - Crypto 
   - Immigration 
   - Calories vs Carbs
   - sleeping
   - longevity 
   - electric cars
   - going to mars
   - cryonics
   - Never talk to the cops

# Why Now is interesting

- Multi-Planetary Species
- AI revolutions
- Brain-Machine Interface 
- Longevity
- Ability to kill all of humanity (nukes / bio) 
- Genetic Re-engineering 
- Close to last generation that uses sex to reproduce
- The precipice:
  > Claim that we now possess the ability to destroy ourselves without the wisdom to avoid doing so.
  > => high probability this will happen. 
  > If we can avoid total destruction in next couple 100 years, we will have  the ability to "live forever" 
  

# Things where experts disagree

- Interpretations of QM
- Fermi Paradox
- Future of AI / AGI
- Future of Brain-Machine-Interface
- Hierarchy Problem
- CC 
- Universe as Simulation
- Free will ? 
- Consensus 
- Cryonics

# Numbers

- 100 billion neurons in the brain

# Quotations 

- “We are what we repeatedly do,” Aristotle said, “therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit.”

# Mental Models

- Bias Variance Trade off
- Lepton Fake Factor
- Closure Test
- Circle of Competencies
  > Understand/be aware of what you dont know and what you are not an expert it.
  > Probe to find where the limits of "experts" are
- First principles thinking
  > Exactly what physics trains for. 
  > Look for moving parts, knowns/unknowns and see how things fit together.  
  > Ignore the stories that you cant understand. 
  > Doubt everything that you cant get to from axioms.
- The map is not the territory
  > Understand the limits/inherent simplifications in the model
  > Need different maps of the same territory to convey different relevant information
  > Maps/models are tools, decisions should ultimately reflect the reality of the situation/territory.
  > Physics Examples: EFTs
- Law of diminishing returns
  > Example of 80/20 
  > Get the low hanging fruit
  > Acquire breath of knowledge at the 80/20 level. 
  > Then choose what long sloughs to fith. 
- 2nd order thinking
  > Consider the consequences of the consequences of your action
  > Obviously want to to as high an order as possible
  > Developing trust is a great example (Be reliable ! See dont lie and be the good)

# North Stars : 

Karol Krizka: has the nature that when something comes up (no matter how big or small) he digs deeply to the root cause to fix or improve the problem. Was especially apparent to me when working with him on FTK commissioning. Leeds to deep knowledge in various areas that are likely to come up again. Builds expertise in debugging technical problems (motivates the building of a Linux machine). Example of compounding returns.
"How you do everything is how you do anything"
