- Bonze Age Collapse: 
  - Great mystery. 
  - Something/Someone destroyed many (most all) the great bronze age civilisations

  - Almost unparralleled in histogry (Collapse of the Roman empire comes close) 
  - Utterly changed (degraded) life for the peoples of the time
  - Ushered in a dark ages (far darker/longer) than "the dark ages" (After the fall of the Roman empire)
  - Cautionary tale for us today. Great/Advanced civilisations can be easily, and quickly, obliterated.

- "Steppe People"
  - Critical role throughout history.
  - Responsible for fall of the Roman Empire (Huns)

- League of Nations: 
  - UN is based on the LoN. (Basically is a watered down version).  
  - LoN proposed a universal language Esperanto. 
  - Assumed countries agreed war was bad; not true of the fascist states. 
  - Us went to war w/Korea largely b/c of the agreements in the UN. 


- Alexander the Great: ATG probably just as bad as Hitler. 
  - At lease Hitler thought we was doing good. 
  - ATG just doing it for his glory. 
  - Will we come to see Hitler as we see ATG in 1000y ? 


- Leviathan: "Pre-state" societies probably much more egalitarian. If you dont like how your being treated you can pick up and leave. 

- Punic Wars:
  - Lots of analogies to WWI and WWII

- Role of radicals:
  
  > Claim: The dangerous thing abou the French Revolution and the
    Soviet Unions early days was that they were casueswhere radicals
    got hold of an entire country. They then became hot-beds for
    radical thinking. Claim is that they had a major impact on ~All
    europe and the US. Leead to US extreme panic during the red scare.
