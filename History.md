- Cognitive revolution: History separates from biology. Narrative is now primary means of explaining the development of humans (Not biological theories) 

- "History is Philosophy taught with examples"

- "Character is destiny 

- Bonze Age Collapse: 
  - Great mystery. 
  - Something/Someone destroyed many (most all) the great bronze age civilisations 
  - Happened extremely suddenly, not sure what caused it. 
  - Almost unparralleled in histogry (Collapse of the Roman empire comes close) 
  - Utterly changed (degraded) life for the peoples of the time
  - Ushered in a dark ages (far darker/longer) than "the dark ages" (After the fall of the Roman empire)
  - Cautionary tale for us today. Great/Advanced civilisations can be easily, and quickly, obliterated.

- "Steppe People"
  - Critical role throughout history.
  - Responsible for fall of the Roman Empire (Huns)
  - Cause of Crusades
  - Several Chinese Dynasties from Steppe invasions

  - WWI brought us: WWII/ Middle East / Israel / Revolution in Russia/ Cold war/ Britain and France no longer the most powerful nations)

  > Ignore facts and figures.  Focus on the moral lessions, what the
  > characters teach you about life.

- League of Nations: 
  - UN is based on the LoN. (Basically is a watered down version).  
  - LoN proposed a universal language Esperanto. 
  - Assumed countries agreed war was bad; not true of the fascist states. 
  - Us went to war w/Korea largely b/c of the agreements in the UN. 


- Alexander the Great: ATG probably just as bad as Hitler. 
  - At lease Hitler thought we was doing good. 
  - ATG just doing it for his glory. 
  - Will we come to see Hitler as we see ATG in 1000y ? 


- Leviathan: "Pre-state" societies probably much more egalitarian. If you dont like how your being treated you can pick up and leave.

- Role of radicals:
  
  > Claim: The dangerous thing abou the French Revolution and the
    Soviet Unions early days was that they were casueswhere radicals
    got hold of an entire country. They then became hot-beds for
    radical thinking. Claim is that they had a major impact on ~All
    europe and the US. Leead to US extreme panic during the red scare.

- World went from having 0 communist countries to having a significant fraction of the world (on all continents) be communist in ~30 years.

- “The dead outnumber the living 14 to 1, and we ignore the accumulated experience of such a huge majority of mankind at our peril.”

- Vietnam
  > For the Vietnamese end game was political power, not body count. They were able to "lose" battles in terms of body count, if it furthered the long-term agenda. 
  > Very hard for the other side to win a war like that. Was a watershed moment in US culture: Changed trust in goverment. Broke the army. Major impact on US foreign policy.

- 10k Greeks
  > - Mercenaries fighting in Persia in 400 BCE
  > - Got tricked into fighting on the losing side of a Persian civial war
  > - Stranded 2000 miles from home in enemy territory

Sapiens:
  - Ever since the French revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other.
    The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction.
  - One of the distinguishing marks of history - the better you know a particular historical period the *harder* it becomes to explain why things happened one way and not another.
  - Unlike physics or economics, history  is not a means for making accurate predictions. We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.
  - Most history books say nothing about how the course of history has influenced the happiness and suffering of individuals. This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history.
